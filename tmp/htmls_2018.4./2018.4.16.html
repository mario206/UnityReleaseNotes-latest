This prevents all sorts of possible corruption scenarios (e.g. read-only directories, partially-read-only packages in the package cache) and avoids some permission issues when removing packages.</p></li><li><p>Package Manager: Changed the package installation process to systematically revert packages to their original state. <strong>Note:</strong> this has the side-effect of actively reverting local modifications in immutable packages, which could previously be kept until the dependency was updated to a different version of the package. In order to preserve local changes, a package should first be [embedded in the project](<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-embed.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-embed.html</a>).</p></li></ul><h4 id="improvements">Improvements</h4><ul><li><p>Package Manager: Added support for configuring additional SSL certificate authorities, including self-signed certificates. See the [Unity Manual](<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-network.html#SSL">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-network.html#SSL</a>) for more information on how to use this.</p></li><li><p>Package Manager: Added support for Git URLs with the SCP format (e.g. <code>git@github.com/user/repo</code>).</p></li><li><p>Package Manager: Added support for Git URLs without a trailing <code>.git</code> by using <code>git://</code> URLs or prepending <code>git+</code> to URLs (e.g. <code>git+https://github.com/user/repo</code>).</p></li><li><p>Package Manager: Added support for tarball-based dependencies (e.g. <code>"file:.tgz"</code>).</p></li><li><p>Package Manager: Changed the <code>UnityEditor.PackageManager.Client.Add</code> method to make the <code>@</code> prefix optional when adding Git-based dependencies and local dependencies (<code>file:</code>).</p></li><li><p>Package Manager: Reduced the amount of data transferred over the network when fetching package metadata from the registry.</p></li></ul><h4 id="features">Features</h4><ul><li>Multiplayer: Added UNET encryption support.</li></ul>
