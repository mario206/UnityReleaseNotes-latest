(<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-core-libraries-are-not-detected-when-theyre-just-in-the-asset-folder-when-building-app-bundle">1374774</a>)</p></li><li><p>Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where BuildPlayerOptions.assetBundleManifestPath to be used when building player was not allowed. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/buildplayeroptions-dot-assetbundlemanifestpath-can-not-be-set-by-using-buildplayerwindow-dot-registerbuildplayerhandler">1399616</a>)</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a bug when calling profiling <code>CreateMarker</code> on iOS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find <code>CreateMarker__Unmanaged</code>.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a issue where burst was enabled in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler (see changelog entry for 1.6.0-pre.1 for more context around this).</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed an access violation error that could occur when reading from a static readonly variable.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed an exception that could occur if you had the Burst AOT Settings menu docked in the Editor, and then did a player build. Trying to change any of the Burst AOT Settings would throw an exception (unless you closed and reopened the Burst AOT Settings).</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed an issue where codegen differences could occur when using a local vector variable that was being captured by reference and passed to a called function, versus when it wasn't.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed an issue where if there were two generic structs overlapping at the same <code>FieldOffset</code> in an explicitly laid out struct, a codegen error would occur.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed an issue where if you used <code>FloatMode.Fast</code> with <code>math.pow</code>, where the <code>y</code> argument to <code>math.pow</code> was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (LLVM would try and call out to <code>powf</code> from the cstdlib).</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed another rare case of the file-is-locked bug where the Burst IL Post Processor could incorrectly hold a file lock on a pdb.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed errors when working with paths containing special characters.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed the Burst <code>link.xml</code> output to preserve C# methods we rely on, alongside the static constructors that we preserved previously.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Improved UWP linker error message to clarify which VS components need to be installed for UWP.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Made <code>--burst-force-sync-compilation</code> command-line option actually work.</p></li><li><p>Editor: Fixed a NullReference when showing UnityEvent popup and the GameObject contained a component with a missing script.
