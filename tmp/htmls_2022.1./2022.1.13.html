In addition, a few other iOS Bluetooth audio bugs were fixed. When starting up with Bluetooth headphones connected, audio output used to play through the built-in speakers (which was an error). The list of available microphones was not always correct when connecting / dis-connecting Bluetooth headphones at runtime. Bluetooth microphone input was really choppy.

If the project was previously upgraded to 2021.3, this may cause the builds to start up on a different display first. Use Win + Shift + Left/Right arrow to move the window to the desired display. (UUM-4178)</p></li><li><p>Windows: Fixed resolution misdetection on vertical displays, which caused APIs like Screen.currentResolution or Screen.GetDisplayLayout() return wrong data and the player contain letterboxing when it shouldn't. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-player-does-not-refresh-window-display-properties-when-opening-the-player-on-another-display">UUM-7552</a>)</p></li><li><p>Windows: Restore the display enumeration behaviour of Unity 2021.1 and earlier: the primary display will always be treated as display 1.</p></li></ul><h4 id="package-changes-in-2022113f1">Package changes in 2022.1.13f1</h4>
