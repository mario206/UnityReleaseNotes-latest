in a static constructor would result in a Burst failure.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a bug in the entry-point finding code whereby we wouldn't correctly resolve a nested generic struct's job if it was within a concrete generic class that was outwith the root assembly set.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a bug in the fixed string processing whereby we'd miscompile a fixed string that was within a struct inside a <code>SharedStatic</code> (depending on how it was used).</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a bug that could prevent Visual Studio locating .pdb files while debugging.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a

this).</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a bug that was exposed by a Script Updater running against the Entities tests, whereby if some sort of pre-domain-reload code (some sort of teardown like thing) called into Burst, the script updater could have caused Burst to purge valid function pointers, resulting in us trying to execute a DLL location that we had already unloaded.</p></li><li><p>Burst:

unlucky) block trying to dirty the assembly in our Burst caching infrastructure while waiting for the compilation to complete.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a bug where our <code>[BurstCompile]</code> job finding code would not find methods in generic base classes in places where we knew the concrete-generic type (for instance <code>struct Foo { [BurstCompile] struct MyJob : IJob { void Execute()

<code>IJobParallelFor</code> where vectorization didn't happen for cases where it previously would have.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a really subtle caching bug in the compiler where if you had a job

combination then Burst might accidentally never recompile the job which failed previously.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a super rare bug whereby if you kicked off two compilations very close together (most likely when running Unity in some sort of headless build-a-player mode), Burst could throw an exception on a burst hash cache file being locked by the process.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed a Unity 2021.2 and newer bug that manifested with UWP builds - we were using the wrong <code>unityaot</code> folder in the Unity editor distribution with Burst.</p></li><li><p>Burst: Fixed access
