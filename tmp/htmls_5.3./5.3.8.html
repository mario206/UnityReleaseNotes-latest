(840596)</li><li>IL2CPP: Fixed a crash that could occur in the player when a virtual method was called on a value type and that value type implemented an interface which had an overload of that virtual method. (849701)</li><li>IL2CPP: Fixed stacktraces on iOS when Link Time Optimization (LTO) was enabled in the build.
