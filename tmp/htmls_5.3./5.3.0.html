Scenes might need re-tuning.</li><li>Graphics: Implemented shadow bias for point lights. Previously was not implemented, might need re-tuning.</li><li>Physics: HingeJoints now have orientation to be compatible with Unity 4. The Rigidbody that share the GameObject with the HingeJoint will view the Joint anchor as a left-hand coordinate system. This means the Rigidbody will view positive angles as going clockwise around the Joint anchor. The HingeJoint "Connected Body" will view the Joint anchor as a right-hand coordinate system. This means the Connected Body will view positive angles as going counter-clockwise around the Joint anchor.</li><li>Physics: Obsoleted enum JointDriveMode and JointDrive.mode</li><li>Physics: When changing a mesh and subsequently setting it as the sharedMesh of a MeshCollider we now update collision mesh instead of ignoring the changes.</li><li>Shaders: “Precompiled” shaders (e.g. pasting result from “show generated code” into shader asset itself) are not working anymore. This was deprecated before in Unity 5.2.</li><li>Shaders: Smoothness curve of Standard shader matches Substance Painter and Marmoset Toolbag2 (only when tools are using GGX) very closely now. Your smoothness textures might need an update.</li><li>Shaders: To improve visual quality of specular highlight Standard shader is now using GGX distribution function.

They all redirect to equivalent APIs on EditorSceneManager or SceneManager but it is recommended to start using the new APIs instead.</li><li>Editor: Don't show disabled context button for assets without a context menu</li><li>Editor: EditorGUIUtility.RenderGameViewCameras() marked obsolete. It was poorly designed API, and it appears nobody uses it anyway. We'll give it at least one minor release until we remove it entirely, in order to see if anyone is actually using it.</li><li>Editor: Screen.lockCursor will not be reset when clicking with mouse</li><li>Graphics: OpenGL core (3.2 - 4.1) API is used by default on Mac OS X and Linux now.</li><li>iOS: Use launch screens as primary source for splash images</li><li>Particles: Enable dynamic collisions checkbox by default</li><li>Particles: Setting playOnAwake through script will now change all systems that are part of the emitter, matches the inspectors behaviour.</li><li>Physics: 2D physics (Box2D) now reports out-of-memory errors rather than simply crashing.</li><li>Physics: Added PlatformEffector2D.sideArc to replace PlatformEffector2D.sideAngleVariance as well as adding the missing gizmo for sides</li><li>Physics: Allow the PhysX CharacterController to consider the slope limit for Rigidbodies. This fixes bugs where the CharacterController could climb on very steep slopes on Rigidbodies.

This makes GetComponentInChildren work on prefabs, and only changes behaviour in cases where previously you were guaranteed to get an empty array as result.</li><li><p>GI: Greatly improved precompute performance (and bake as a side effect)! Clustering and light transport stages of the precompute are now considerably faster thanks to the upgrade to Enlighten 3.02. The entire precompute became 1.5-2 times faster. The precompute is currently a part of the bake, so bakes got faster too. <img alt="description" src="/sites/default/files/5.3.0-relnotes-gi-perf-improvements.png"></p></li><li><p>GI: Increase maximum allowed GI cache size.</p></li><li>GI: Move Atlas Size to Baked GI section in Lighting window.</li><li>GI: Renamed LightmapSnapshot to LightingDataAsset</li><li>Graphics: Added Mesh.GetUVs with overloads for List, List, List</li><li>Graphics: <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MultiDisplay.html">Ability to render to multiple displays on PC</a>.</li><li>Graphics: CommandBuffer.SetShadowSamplingMode() can be used to enable sampling raw depth value from shadowmaps, to be copied or post-processed by user effects.</li><li>Graphics: Expose GraphicsSettings class to scripting API.</li><li>Graphics: Fixed deferred lighting spot light artifacts on mobile (black pixels around edges of objects)</li><li>Graphics: Fixed OpenGL ES on desktop support: correctly fetch normal and specular maps</li><li>Graphics: More detailed breakdown of forward rendering pipeline in Profiler.</li><li>Graphics: Reflection cubemap convolution is GGX now.</li><li>Graphics: Reflection cubemap convolution preserves HDR highlights better.</li><li>Graphics: Various dynamic geometry systems (Particles, Sprites, Lines, Trails, Flares, Halos) use multi-threaded "geometry job" system. Yay more multi-threading!</li><li>Horizontal text alignment now uses the actual glyph geometry extents (rather than character advance) greatly improving the visual appearance of right alignment.</li><li>Imported fonts now match any other font with the same family name as implicit fallbacks. This allows multiple styles to be used with a single font and the text generator will automatically use the appropriate face.</li><li>Improved "The referenced script on this Behaviour" message with the game object name in the player, it will look now like 'The referenced script on this Behaviour (Game Object 'Main Camera') is missing!'.</li><li>Input: Added Input.backButtonLeavesApp, usable on Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8.1 and Android, see docs for more info</li><li>InputField no longer dirties the UI batch for the caret blink cycle when the caret is not visible.</li><li>Integrated the industry standard for tangent space "mikktspace" into Unity. This allows artists to get seamless lighting since compatibility is ensured between normal map baker and renderer (particular xNormal and several other bakers).</li><li>iOS: Added frameworks new in iOS 8.0 to 9.0 to the plugin importer UI.</li><li>iOS: Added support for iPad launch screens</li><li>MacOSX editor: The graphics API used by the editor is included in the editor title bar just like on Windows</li><li>Mecanim: Additive Layer improvement. You can now specify the reference pose for your additive animation clip.

From now on, setting a custom centre of mass won't mark the inertia tensor as set explicitly as well. By analogy, setting inertia tensor won't have an instant effect on the centre of mass. Exposed two new API functions to reset the centre of mass and inertia tensor back to the automatically computed values. See also: Rigidbody.ResetCenterOfMass(),Rigidbody.ResetInertiaTensor(),Rigidbody.centerOfMass, Rigidbody.inertiaTensor, Rigidbody.inertiaTensorRotation.</li><li>Pointer selection across multiple lines in UI.InputField is improved.</li><li>Reflection Probes: Ability to turn off deferred reflections when using deferred shading.
