### 2023.2.7f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   iOS: Add Apple Privacy Manifest support.

#### Improvements

*   URP: Enable renderViewportScale for XR intermediate textures.

#### Changes

*   Burst: Update default LLVM to version 16

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed issue where a SpriteShapeRenderer with mask interaction set is unable to be masked by a SpriteMask when using a URP pipeline. ([UUM-59737](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-mask-is-not-masking-sprites-when-using-spriteshape))
    
*   2D: Fixed local bounds of 2D Freeform Light from changing when scene is reloaded. ([UUM-49000](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/local-bounds-values-of-2d-freeform-light-change-when-the-scene-is-reloaded))
    
*   Android: Updated GetEngineGradleDependencies() API to return asset pack dependencies. (UUM-21692)
    
*   Animation: Fixed erroneous discrete int and enum default values written back by the Animator. ([UUM-58573](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-enum-properties-get-set-to-0-instead-of-the-value-specified-in-the-scene-when-the-property-is-animated-by-a-state-that-is-not-playing))
    
*   Audio: Fixed AudioMixer clicks when abruptly changing volume in Start(). ([UUM-368](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-plays-for-a-split-second-when-mixers-volume-is-set-to-0-beforehand))
    
*   Burst: Burst recompiles assemblies due to hashes mismatching because of the way assembly defines are combined into the hash.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where underflows of nint and nuint at compile time would lead to incorrect code.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where use of certain intrinsics could cause a compile error even if properly guarded by the appropriate `IsXXXSupported` property.
    
*   Burst: Fixed android builds throwing a NullReferenceException.
    
*   Burst: Fixed arithmetic and bitwise negation on native integers.
    
*   Burst: Fixed burst not differentiating between overloaded generic functions such as T foo(int val) and T foo(T val) when the function calls are foo(1); foo<int>(1). Burst would previously only compile the T foo(T val) function.
    
*   Burst: Fixed constant SHUFFLE function not seen as a constant when called indirectly through a `FunctionPointer`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions `cvt_ss2si`, `cvtss_si32`, and `cvtss_si64` to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even.
    
*   Burst: If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted. In order to fix this ( editor only - player builds are unaffected), we now save some additional context on each entry point.
    
*   Editor: Editor crash if a compilation error happened during import from code altering compilation assets during activate. ([UUM-58299](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-trytoregistermonoscripttohashmap-when-importing-a-specific-unitypackage))
