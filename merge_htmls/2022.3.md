*   AI: The HeightMesh was sometimes containing faulty polygons that stretched between arbitrary vertices over long distances. ([UUM-78065](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/height-mesh-generation-results-in-unexpected-spikes-slash-streaks-across-the-whole-map-in-the-generated-navmesh-surface-when-re-baking))
    
*   Android: Fixed issue preventing DXC from being used for Android Vulkan.

([UUM-99493](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/all-animators-previous-animations-are-activated-while-transitioning-when-a-second-split-off-transition-overrides-the-first-split-off-transition))

Renderers for tree instances would still be updated but this is not particularly useful or wanted if you are using some other system to render Tree instances. So now the updating of tree instances is bypassed in this scenario. Re-enabling tree rendering will resume updating tree instance and detail renderers. When tree rendering is enabled, performance remains roughly the same as before. ([UUM-98086](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/frame-spike-due-to-many-treerenderer-dot-treeupdated-calls-when-repositioning-terrains-in-large-scenes))

([UUM-96066](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/calling-texture2d-dot-getrawdata-on-a-texture-with-astc-format-returns-different-results-when-the-editor-is-started-without-library-folder-and-then-restarted-with-library-folder))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where the value reported by "Texture.nonStreamingTextureMemory" would not update when mipmap limits were modified. ([UUM-79327](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-dot-nonstreamingtexturememory-value-does-not-update-when-qualitysettings-dot-globaltexturemipmaplimit-is-changed))

([UUM-73042](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/raw-image-that-uses-a-material-with-a-custom-shader-is-invisible-in-canvas-when-screen-space-overlay-is-set-and-the-player-is-in-windowed-mode))
    
*   Graphics: When using the Metal graphics API, SystemInfo.SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat() will now check the Metal device's readWriteTextureSupport tier to check whether a texture format supports simultaneous read and writes in a shader. With this change, this function will now return false for some texture formats that previously made it return true. One example is RenderTextureFormat.RG16 that previously made it return true but now false is returned instead. ([UUM-70740](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/supportsrandomwriteonrendertextureformat-shows-false-when-executed-on-2023-dot-2-and-6000-dot-0-streams))

*   Particles: Scheduling a Particle System job outside of MonoBehaviour.OnParticleUpdateJobScheduled() will now generate an InvalidOperationException in order to prevent incorrect job schedules which could cause a hang. ([UUM-79599](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-freezes-slash-hangs-when-calling-schedulebatch-for-ijobparticlesystemparallelforbatch))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue with the Cloth component's inspector where exiting play-mode with the self and inter collision tool open would cause a null reference exception. ([UUM-78853](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-nullreferenceexception-object-reference-not-set-to-an-instance-of-an-object-and-cannot-modify-overlay-dot-displayed-during-event-of-type-eventtype-dot-layout-shown-when-entering-the-play-mode-with-self-collision-and-inter-collision-window-focused))
    
*   Physics: Revert fix for small body tunnelling at high (~200Hz) simulation frequencies. If effected please use recommended workaround (decrease ccd threshold to slightly under 1/4 of the half-extent of the scene's smallest object).

*   Shaders: Fixed a copy/paste issue when right-clicking on the property of shader created with TexturePropertySingleLine(). (UUM-78130)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed compute shader compilation variant cache hits to be reported correctly in the editor log. ([UUM-75264](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-cache-is-not-used-when-building-the-player-repeatedly))

#### API Changes

*   iOS: Added: Added iPhone 16 device generation enums and screen cutouts.

#### Fixes

*   Asset Bundles: Improved performance of AssetBundle.UnloadAsync. In certain large bundles with many scenes, the async unloading could take an excessively long time.
    
*   Audio: Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to throw a null reference exception when selecting a clip with auto play turned on. ([UUM-71823](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-is-thrown-when-clicking-on-the-audio-clip-with-auto-play-enabled))
    
*   Editor: Fixed crash when a Material Variant was missing its grandparent. ([UUM-77741](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-when-selecting-a-material-variant-whose-grandparent-has-been-deleted))

*   HDRP: This PR fixes the artifact of non-physical DOF if it's used with TAA and dynamic resolution; The artifacts appear for a frame after the screen resolution changes. ([UUM-70751](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/game-view-renders-artifacts-when-cameras-component-post-anti-aliasing-is-set-to-taa-and-dynamic-resolutions-forced-screen-percentage-is-changed))

*   Physics: Fixed an issue with cloth self collision where setting and clearing self collision indices would cause simulation artifacts unless self collision distance was set to 0.0f prior to clearing. Now when clearing self collision indices distance/stiffness no longer play a role in the simulation of the cloth component. ([UUM-78851](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-self-collision-and-inter-collision-on-a-cloth-is-still-applied-when-the-self-collision-and-inter-collision-checkbox-is-un-ticked-and-the-self-collision-distance-is-non-zero))

*   Version Control: Fixed token renewal issue: Can't obtain a new token (Message: Invalid Refresh Token., Code: 132.104).

### Known Issues in 2022.3.49f1

*   Addressable Assets: \[Android\] \[Entities\] Build fails with the error “Asset has disappeared while building player to 'globalgamemanagers.assets' - path '', instancedID '-xxxxxx'“ when building ([UUM-41830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-entities-build-fails-with-the-error-asset-has-disappeared-while-building-player-to-globalgamemanagers-dot-assets-path-instancedid-xxxxxx-when-building))

### 2022.3.49f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Particles: Added 2 new sorting modes for reversed depth.

#### API Changes

*   Editor: Added: Added an api in CloudProjectSettings to get the Services Gateway token.

#### Changes

*   Editor: Updated OpenXR to 1.12.1.

#### Fixes

*   Animation: Fixed an issue where entry transitions were not reporting warnings when one of their parameters was deleted. ([UUM-77622](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/deleting-a-parameter-in-an-animator-does-not-bring-up-a-warning-message-when-the-parameter-is-in-use-by-a-transition-from-the-entry-state))
    
*   Editor: Fixed rendering issues with XRSettings.RenderViewportScale when using OpenXR. ([UUM-19440](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-openxr-xrsettings-dot-renderviewportscale-with-urp-give-incorrect-results-when-the-value-is-less-than-1))
    
*   Editor: Fixed the wrong texture being set (due to resource name leaking) for half res downsample: instead of using \_CameraDepthTexture which could be anything, using an new explicit name \_SourceDownsampleDepth.  
    When hardware DRS is on, we can safely assume that the ratio between the input and output textures is 1 because the GPU hardware sizes are watertight. (UUM-64133)
    
*   Editor: Skip caching MonoScripts in the accelerator that have not compiled successfully. (UUM-65374)
    
*   Editor: Switched to using more specific keys for caching splash screens rather than clearing the splash screen cache on all changes. Clearing out the splash screen hash could cause race conditions that would fail a build. If splash screens are not being cached properly you can clear out the cache before a build by deleting the SplashScreenCache folder in the Library. ([UUM-41830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-entities-build-fails-with-the-error-asset-has-disappeared-while-building-player-to-globalgamemanagers-dot-assets-path-instancedid-xxxxxx-when-building))
    
*   Graphics: Cleared materialPropertyBlocks after each Blit to avoid interference between blits. (UUM-29958)
    
*   Graphics: Removed error message in Graphics.Blit when materials MainTex binding is set. ([UUM-72740](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/material-uses-dest-texture-as-input-in-pass-0-its-an-undefined-behaviour-error-when-calling-graphics-dot-blip-function))
    
*   iOS: Fixed crash when rendering to backbuffer in Update. ([UUM-72740](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/material-uses-dest-texture-as-input-in-pass-0-its-an-undefined-behaviour-error-when-calling-graphics-dot-blip-function))
    
*   iOS: Fixed occasional hang on some devices when tweaking autorotation. ([UUM-75124](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-player-freezes-with-a-warning-a-new-orientation-transaction-token-is-being-requested-while-a-valid-one-already-exists-when-orientation-is-changed-during-runtime-on-a-specific-devices))
    
*   Kernel: Fixed memory ordering bug which could have caused a crash or hang in the job system. (UUM-78983)
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where installing a non-discoverable package in the Unity Inspector would trigger an error. This update ensures smooth installation of non-discoverable packages without causing interruptions or errors in the Inspector. (UUM-78074)
    
*   Particles: Fixed potential unbounded memory and excessive work when using Ring Buffer mode. ([UUM-72277](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-allocates-large-amounts-of-memory-when-it-is-very-far-away-from-the-origin-of-the-scene))
    
*   Physics 2D: When using Rigidbody2D interpolation and changing the Transform directly, the Transform pose has the priority for interpolation whereas when changing the Rigidbody2D pose directly, the Rigidbody2D pose has the priority over the Transform. This stops "jitter" issues when driving the Rigidbody2D constantly via the Transform. This still isn't a recommended practice however. ([UUM-82789](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2d-physics-makes-object-movements-to-flicker))
    
*   Scene/Game View: Fixed Orientation overlay styling. ([UUM-79216](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/orientation-overlays-drag-handle-has-no-padding-on-its-left-in-scene-view))
    
*   Tests: Fixed AsyncInstantiateObjectChildrenTransformValidationNoPositionRotationParent instability by reducing floating point comparison precision. (UUM-72578)

*   Profiler: Fixed "Page range is outside of system region range. Please report a bug!" error for captured memory snapshots and opened in the Memory Profiler packaged, caused by Unity Objects getting created in-between of capturing the Managed Heap and Native Object data. Snapshots before this fix are not fixed by this change but future captures won't have the same issue. This also fixes cases where Unity Objects in a Memory Snapshot might have pointed at invalid data for their Managed Shell, which may have been most notable with MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject types. This may also have fixed a vanishingly small amount of instances of reported "Leaked Managed Shell" objects where the Native Object part of the object got destroyed just after the managed Heap data was captured. The close timing makes the likelihood of all of these issues very rare and more likely the longer it takes to capture a snapshot. (UUM-77449)

### 2022.3.28f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Package Manager: Modifying assets located in immutable packages (under a project's Library/PackageCache folder) will no longer immediately re-resolve the project's packages, which can lead to faster iteration and allow temporary modification of those packages (for instance for testing or debugging purposes). Package Manager operations can still revert changes, so the recommended way to make changes permanent is still to embed packages prior to modifying them.

#### Changes

*   Android: New Google Play asset packs size and number limits. Unity generated asset packs now are always install-time. (UUM-68512)
    
*   Android: New Google Play base module size limit (200Mb). (UUM-67708)
    
*   Android: Updated bundletool up to 1.16.0. (UUM-70552)
    

#### Fixes

([UUM-67826](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-cannot-find-symbol-public-class-unityplayeractivity-extends-com-dot-unity3d-dot-player-dot-unityplayeractivity-error-is-thrown-when-building-for-the-android-platform))

The warning message also includes a button that allows the user to easily add/enable the TerrainCollider component. ([UUM-67250](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/missingcomponentexception-errors-are-thrown-when-using-terrain-with-no-terrain-collider))

To account for special characters and regex that may be present in the user jspre code (see UUM-21896), the final parameter uses a anonymous delegate function to treat the replacement string as a string literal so that it is not processed in any way.

([UUM-58573](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-enum-properties-get-set-to-0-instead-of-the-value-specified-in-the-scene-when-the-property-is-animated-by-a-state-that-is-not-playing))
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed issue where "Multiple plugins with the same name" error occurs when importing bundle files in .androidpack folders on Mac. (UUM-35317)
    
*   Audio: Fixed an issue in visionOS builds where audio would not resume after the app resumes from the background. (LXR-3040)

*   Burst: Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions `cvt_ss2si`, `cvtss_si32`, and `cvtss_si64` to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even.
    
*   Burst: If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted. In order to fix this ( editor only - player builds are unaffected), we now save some additional context on each entry point.
    
*   Editor: Context menus in transient search now respect light mode themes on macOS. ([UUM-59378](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/contextual-menu-the-same-menu-in-different-windows-is-presented-in-different-colors))

*   Editor: Global Settings will always be ensured no matter what RP is active. (UUM-47264)
    
*   Editor: Increased VisionOS Metal RuntimeVersion to 7 (should enable tessellation).
    
*   Editor: Linux CheckedMenu submenu items not displaying as Checked in some occasions. (UUM-58878)
    
*   Editor: Opening a context menu on macOS will now focus the application so all functions in the hierarchy work. ([UUM-26081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-context-menu-in-hierarchy-is-available-but-not-functional-when-the-editor-is-out-of-focus))
    
*   Editor: Printing proper message into console when compiling mesh data optimization processing to avoid confusing logs. ([UUM-54590](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/variant-count-after-stripping-is-increased-for-the-first-build-after-shader-keyword-changes))
    
*   Editor: Some visionOS builds will no longer fail with an inability to execute process\_symbols.sh.
    
*   GI: Fixed crash on Apple Silicon in llvm::VectorType::get when opening a specific project. ([UUM-59133](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/silicon-crash-on-llvm-vectortype-get-when-opening-a-specific-project))
    
*   Graphics: Clarify RenderTexture creation error wording to use "volumeDepth" instead of "depth". (UUM-59895)
    
*   Graphics: DrawProceduralNow family of functions also provide emulated vertexbuffers. (UUM-51751)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed missed samplerCubeArrayShadow texture binding when processing GLSLang reflection. ([UUM-59188](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-vertex-program-vert-unrecognized-sampler-error-occurs-when-compiling-shader-with-vulkan-api))

*   Graphics: Surface shader path has correct parameters set when emulating vertexbuffers. ([UUM-52930](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/graphics-dot-renderprimitives-does-not-work-when-using-surface-shaders))
    
*   Graphics: When using CaptureScreenshotAsTexture during the rendering process with Metal API, if the results are undefined then Unity now outputs an error instead of crashing. (UUM-47096)
    
*   HDRP: Async compute Presents issues when depending on the first texture read of depth. In some platforms (vulkan/dx12 and some consoles) the first read of depth is actually a write because of decompression / layout / barriers.  
    Async compute is inserting the fence before this operation because RenderGraph sees everything as a simple Read / Write.  
    Temporarily hacking this so the first read of depth is tagged as a write, so the correct fence is inserted. (UUM-57601)

*   Shaders: Ensures internal shader compiler errors such as losing connection to a compiler process aren't cached like compilation errors are. (UUM-28802)

### 2022.3.15f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Burst: Burst support for Apple visionOS.
    
*   Universal RP: Improved renderViewportScale for XR intermediate textures.
    

#### Changes

*   Editor: Added visionOS icons for build target selection and player settings.

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed AnimatedTile not animating in a player build. (UUM-55931)
    
*   2D: Fixed case where URP freeform lights glitch when Light points are close to one another. ([UUM-43318](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-freeform-lights-glitch-when-light-points-are-close-to-one-another))
    
*   AI: Built-in navigation components are no longer hidden from the Add Component menu if the AI Navigation package is not installed. Instead, affected workflows provide shortcuts to install the package.
    
*   AI: Editor: Fixed crashes and instabilities arising from hiding built-in Navigation components in menus. (UUM-53002)
    
*   Android: Bump Android Logcat package to 1.4.0.
    
*   Android: Input device listener processes the callback on UI thread, instead of the Main thread; this was incompatible with GameActivity setup, where Java looper is not present on Unity's main thread. This change fixed the bug where DualShock4 controller was not recognised after being disconnected and reconnected to certain Android devices. ([UUM-52211](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-duolashock4-controller-is-not-detected-after-disconnecting-and-reconnecting-controller-while-the-player-is-running-in-the-background))
    
*   Android: When picking target API level which is not the highest installed API level, Unity will now show a dialog asking if you want install it and will install missing API level upon request, previously Unity would throw an error and would ask you to install API level manually. This new behavior will be available only in non batch mode, in batch mode you would still receive an error, the reason is to avoid potential implicit errors. (UUM-52052)
    
*   Animation: Fixed crash with multithreaded evaluation after calling ApplyOverrides on AnimatorOverrideController. ([UUM-31848](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-on-mono-jit-runtime-invoke-when-entering-the-play-mode))

### 2022.3.10f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Shadergraph: The Shader Graph team has added a new sample content pack that can be installed via the Package Manager. The samples contain descriptions, examples, and break-downs for a majority of the nodes in Shader Graph - helping users understand the inner workings of the nodes and see examples of how they work and how they can be used.

### New 2022.3.0f1 Entries since 2022.2.21f1

#### Fixes

*   Android: Avoid an error generated by the Vulkan loader on Android when trying to load vkGetPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRatesKHR as Vulkan device function
    
*   Android: Filter some redundant warnings on some Adreno devices that cause severe performance issues in development builds
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed crash during Content File loading due to out of bounds array access.
    
*   Core: Allows `NativeArray<T>.Dispose(JobHandle)` to be callabled from a Burst compiled function. Previously an InvalidOperationException would be thrown saying "Reflection data was not set up by an Initialize() call."
    
*   Core: Fixed GameObject being set to dirty after setting active to false when parent is inactive and activeSelf was already false.
    
*   Editor: Fix crash caused by gpu out of mem ([UUM-25089](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-crash-with-multiple-stack-traces-when-opening-a-project-created-from-test-track-template))
    
*   Editor: Fixed margins appearing in game view on Windows displays with non-integer display scale ([UUM-32991](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/game-view-has-huge-borders-around-when-free-aspect-is-selected-on-windows-machine))
    
*   GI: Fixed a bug where moving the camera while in an scene visualization mode would cause light bakes to never finish. (UUM-34425)
    
*   Graphics: Disable Vulkan DebugUtilsLabels for Linux AMD due to driver crash bug (UUM-31640)
