*   AI: The HeightMesh was sometimes containing faulty polygons that stretched between arbitrary vertices over long distances. ([UUM-78065](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/height-mesh-generation-results-in-unexpected-spikes-slash-streaks-across-the-whole-map-in-the-generated-navmesh-surface-when-re-baking))
    
*   Android: Fixed issue preventing DXC from being used for Android Vulkan.
    
*   Animation: Fixed an issue where undoing the creation of an AnimatorController layer while the layer view was not visible in the Animator Window would throw exceptions. ([UUM-104017](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-controller-throws-missingreferenceexception-after-undoing-layer-creation))
    
*   Audio: Fixed dsp stuck in one note loop when behaviour is disabled with OAFR. ([UUM-82219](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audiolistener-is-stuck-on-a-single-audio-note-when-disabling-the-dsp))
    
*   Editor: Avoid calling AnyTargetMaterialHasChildren (which loads assets) when deleting assets. ([UUM-79129](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/significant-time-is-taken-by-the-anytargetmaterialhaschildren-method-when-a-large-non-material-asset-is-deleted))
    
*   Editor: Before running the macOS Editor, perform a check if Rosetta is installed and if not then prompt to install it. (UUM-104562)
    
*   Editor: Editor can crash when playable graph topology is changed by an animation event callback. ([UUM-104081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mecanim-animation-transformvaluesfromclip-when-entering-the-play-mode-in-a-project-with-animancer-pro-v8))
    
*   Editor: Fixed a bug where the 'RectTransform' component values were set to NaN when scaling UI elements using the Scene Rect Tool. ([UUM-102690](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rect-transform-values-are-set-to-nan-when-scaling-ui-element-with-centered-scaling))
    
*   Editor: Fixed a bug whereby when evaluating an interrupted transition, the Animator writes the last evaluated values for all values instead of correctly defaulting to the state's current configuration. ([UUM-99493](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/all-animators-previous-animations-are-activated-while-transitioning-when-a-second-split-off-transition-overrides-the-first-split-off-transition))

*   Editor: Fixed some performance issues when moving Terrain objects (eg. for shifting world origin to support large worlds) while Tree rendering is disabled. Renderers for tree instances would still be updated but this is not particularly useful or wanted if you are using some other system to render Tree instances. So now the updating of tree instances is bypassed in this scenario. Re-enabling tree rendering will resume updating tree instance and detail renderers. When tree rendering is enabled, performance remains roughly the same as before. ([UUM-98086](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/frame-spike-due-to-many-treerenderer-dot-treeupdated-calls-when-repositioning-terrains-in-large-scenes))

*   Graphics: Corrected bounding box transformations in SkinnedMeshRenderer when "Update When Offscreen" is enabled and scaling is applied. ([UUM-69984](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/point-light-does-not-affect-skinnedmeshrenderer-when-its-deformed-has-update-when-offscreen-enabled-and-rendering-path-is-set-to-forward))

([UUM-96066](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/calling-texture2d-dot-getrawdata-on-a-texture-with-astc-format-returns-different-results-when-the-editor-is-started-without-library-folder-and-then-restarted-with-library-folder))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where the value reported by "Texture.nonStreamingTextureMemory" would not update when mipmap limits were modified. ([UUM-79327](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-dot-nonstreamingtexturememory-value-does-not-update-when-qualitysettings-dot-globaltexturemipmaplimit-is-changed))

*   HLSLcc: Fixed a bug where the int variable's data type was assumed to be a uint and not explicitly checked before attempting to be used with uintBitsToFloat. ([UUM-100116](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/compilation-errors-occur-when-uintbitstofloat-int-gets-used-in-opengles))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed finalizers being called in a reentrant manner on the Web platform. Finalizers are now invoked explicitly at the end of each frame if needed. ([UUM-99176](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/native-code-called-abort-is-thrown-in-webgl-player-when-loading-first-scene))

*   Editor: Windows moved to a different display on Windows upon display disconnect will no longer have the minimum size.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed issue in which raw Image that uses a Material with a custom Shader is invisible in Canvas when "Screen Space - Overlay" is set and the Player is in "Windowed" mode. ([UUM-73042](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/raw-image-that-uses-a-material-with-a-custom-shader-is-invisible-in-canvas-when-screen-space-overlay-is-set-and-the-player-is-in-windowed-mode))
    
*   Graphics: When using the Metal graphics API, SystemInfo.SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat() will now check the Metal device's readWriteTextureSupport tier to check whether a texture format supports simultaneous read and writes in a shader. With this change, this function will now return false for some texture formats that previously made it return true. One example is RenderTextureFormat.RG16 that previously made it return true but now false is returned instead. ([UUM-70740](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/supportsrandomwriteonrendertextureformat-shows-false-when-executed-on-2023-dot-2-and-6000-dot-0-streams))

*   Particles: Scheduling a Particle System job outside of MonoBehaviour.OnParticleUpdateJobScheduled() will now generate an InvalidOperationException in order to prevent incorrect job schedules which could cause a hang. ([UUM-79599](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-freezes-slash-hangs-when-calling-schedulebatch-for-ijobparticlesystemparallelforbatch))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue with the Cloth component's inspector where exiting play-mode with the self and inter collision tool open would cause a null reference exception. ([UUM-78853](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-nullreferenceexception-object-reference-not-set-to-an-instance-of-an-object-and-cannot-modify-overlay-dot-displayed-during-event-of-type-eventtype-dot-layout-shown-when-entering-the-play-mode-with-self-collision-and-inter-collision-window-focused))
    
*   Physics: Revert fix for small body tunnelling at high (~200Hz) simulation frequencies. If effected please use recommended workaround (decrease ccd threshold to slightly under 1/4 of the half-extent of the scene's smallest object).
    
*   Shadergraph: Added issue where precision mismatch could result in an asset failing to import. ([UUM-74920](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/invalidoperationexception-precision-mismatch-error-is-thrown-in-the-console-when-multiplying-two-half-precision-values-in-a-multiply-node-with-single-precision-in-shader-graph))
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed a bug that a shader graph is reverted to its last saved state when entering Play Mode without saving changes. ([UUM-49399](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-graph-is-reverted-to-its-primary-state-when-entering-play-mode-without-saving-changes))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed a copy/paste issue when right-clicking on the property of shader created with TexturePropertySingleLine(). (UUM-78130)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed compute shader compilation variant cache hits to be reported correctly in the editor log. ([UUM-75264](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-cache-is-not-used-when-building-the-player-repeatedly))

### 2022.3.50f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Shaders: Improved shader compilation logging in the player. ([UUM-79781](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/log-shader-compilation-does-not-give-info-on-which-shader-instance-had-a-variant-compiled))

#### API Changes

*   iOS: Added: Added iPhone 16 device generation enums and screen cutouts.

#### Fixes

*   Asset Bundles: Improved performance of AssetBundle.UnloadAsync. In certain large bundles with many scenes, the async unloading could take an excessively long time.
    
*   Audio: Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to throw a null reference exception when selecting a clip with auto play turned on. ([UUM-71823](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-is-thrown-when-clicking-on-the-audio-clip-with-auto-play-enabled))
    
*   Editor: Fixed crash when a Material Variant was missing its grandparent. ([UUM-77741](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-when-selecting-a-material-variant-whose-grandparent-has-been-deleted))
    
*   Editor: Fixed the texture's alpha appears as opaque white when the texture format is set to BC7. ([UUM-77153](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-importer-alpha-swizzle-does-not-work-when-textures-are-originally-opaque))
    
*   Editor: Linux Editor no longer crashes when attempting to drag from the Project window to the Scene View. ([UUM-79812](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-crash-on-pptr-operator-runtimeanimatorcontroller-star-const-when-saving-a-new-animation-file))
    
*   HDRP: This PR fixes the artifact of non-physical DOF if it's used with TAA and dynamic resolution; The artifacts appear for a frame after the screen resolution changes. ([UUM-70751](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/game-view-renders-artifacts-when-cameras-component-post-anti-aliasing-is-set-to-taa-and-dynamic-resolutions-forced-screen-percentage-is-changed))

*   Physics: Fixed an issue with cloth self collision where setting and clearing self collision indices would cause simulation artifacts unless self collision distance was set to 0.0f prior to clearing. Now when clearing self collision indices distance/stiffness no longer play a role in the simulation of the cloth component. ([UUM-78851](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-self-collision-and-inter-collision-on-a-cloth-is-still-applied-when-the-self-collision-and-inter-collision-checkbox-is-un-ticked-and-the-self-collision-distance-is-non-zero))
    
*   Universal RP: Fixed Depth Buffer flickering during screen recording in Android Application. ([UUM-77428](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-depth-texture-is-flickering-on-adreno-device-when-graphics-api-is-set-to-vulkan))
    
*   Version Control: Fixed token renewal issue: Can't obtain a new token (Message: Invalid Refresh Token., Code: 132.104).

### Known Issues in 2022.3.49f1

*   Addressable Assets: \[Android\] \[Entities\] Build fails with the error “Asset has disappeared while building player to 'globalgamemanagers.assets' - path '', instancedID '-xxxxxx'“ when building ([UUM-41830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-entities-build-fails-with-the-error-asset-has-disappeared-while-building-player-to-globalgamemanagers-dot-assets-path-instancedid-xxxxxx-when-building))

### 2022.3.49f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Particles: Added 2 new sorting modes for reversed depth.

#### API Changes

*   Editor: Added: Added an api in CloudProjectSettings to get the Services Gateway token.

#### Changes

*   Editor: Updated OpenXR to 1.12.1.

#### Fixes

*   Animation: Fixed an issue where entry transitions were not reporting warnings when one of their parameters was deleted. ([UUM-77622](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/deleting-a-parameter-in-an-animator-does-not-bring-up-a-warning-message-when-the-parameter-is-in-use-by-a-transition-from-the-entry-state))
    
*   Editor: Fixed rendering issues with XRSettings.RenderViewportScale when using OpenXR. ([UUM-19440](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-openxr-xrsettings-dot-renderviewportscale-with-urp-give-incorrect-results-when-the-value-is-less-than-1))
    
*   Editor: Fixed the wrong texture being set (due to resource name leaking) for half res downsample: instead of using \_CameraDepthTexture which could be anything, using an new explicit name \_SourceDownsampleDepth.  
    When hardware DRS is on, we can safely assume that the ratio between the input and output textures is 1 because the GPU hardware sizes are watertight. (UUM-64133)
    
*   Editor: Skip caching MonoScripts in the accelerator that have not compiled successfully. (UUM-65374)
    
*   Editor: Switched to using more specific keys for caching splash screens rather than clearing the splash screen cache on all changes. Clearing out the splash screen hash could cause race conditions that would fail a build. If splash screens are not being cached properly you can clear out the cache before a build by deleting the SplashScreenCache folder in the Library. ([UUM-41830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-entities-build-fails-with-the-error-asset-has-disappeared-while-building-player-to-globalgamemanagers-dot-assets-path-instancedid-xxxxxx-when-building))
    
*   Graphics: Cleared materialPropertyBlocks after each Blit to avoid interference between blits. (UUM-29958)
    
*   Graphics: Removed error message in Graphics.Blit when materials MainTex binding is set. ([UUM-72740](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/material-uses-dest-texture-as-input-in-pass-0-its-an-undefined-behaviour-error-when-calling-graphics-dot-blip-function))
    
*   iOS: Fixed crash when rendering to backbuffer in Update. ([UUM-72740](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/material-uses-dest-texture-as-input-in-pass-0-its-an-undefined-behaviour-error-when-calling-graphics-dot-blip-function))
    
*   iOS: Fixed occasional hang on some devices when tweaking autorotation. ([UUM-75124](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-player-freezes-with-a-warning-a-new-orientation-transaction-token-is-being-requested-while-a-valid-one-already-exists-when-orientation-is-changed-during-runtime-on-a-specific-devices))
    
*   Kernel: Fixed memory ordering bug which could have caused a crash or hang in the job system. (UUM-78983)
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where installing a non-discoverable package in the Unity Inspector would trigger an error. This update ensures smooth installation of non-discoverable packages without causing interruptions or errors in the Inspector. (UUM-78074)
    
*   Particles: Fixed potential unbounded memory and excessive work when using Ring Buffer mode. ([UUM-72277](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-allocates-large-amounts-of-memory-when-it-is-very-far-away-from-the-origin-of-the-scene))
    
*   Physics 2D: When using Rigidbody2D interpolation and changing the Transform directly, the Transform pose has the priority for interpolation whereas when changing the Rigidbody2D pose directly, the Rigidbody2D pose has the priority over the Transform. This stops "jitter" issues when driving the Rigidbody2D constantly via the Transform. This still isn't a recommended practice however. ([UUM-82789](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2d-physics-makes-object-movements-to-flicker))
    
*   Scene/Game View: Fixed Orientation overlay styling. ([UUM-79216](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/orientation-overlays-drag-handle-has-no-padding-on-its-left-in-scene-view))
    
*   Tests: Fixed AsyncInstantiateObjectChildrenTransformValidationNoPositionRotationParent instability by reducing floating point comparison precision. (UUM-72578)
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed override indicator alignment for IMGUI containers. ([UUM-29639](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-override-indicator-is-misaligned-when-editing-a-prefab-that-has-a-script-with-serializable-variables-and-a-propertydrawer))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed zero scale issue when using group transform. ([UUM-75219](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/specific-scroll-view-elements-are-not-rendered-on-the-ui-document))
    
*   URP: Fixed an issue where reflection probes would not render correctly on some platforms in some cases. (UUM-54060)
    
*   VFX Graph: Prevent crash during the update of a Visual Effect when deleting a used Texture. (UUM-82240)
    
*   VisionOS: A few audio app lifecycle issues were fixed on visionOS. Previously, when moving the Unity app through the various lifecycle states (i.e. foreground, background), audio could stop playing in error. (UUM-60646)

*   Profiler: Fixed "Page range is outside of system region range. Please report a bug!" error for captured memory snapshots and opened in the Memory Profiler packaged, caused by Unity Objects getting created in-between of capturing the Managed Heap and Native Object data. Snapshots before this fix are not fixed by this change but future captures won't have the same issue. This also fixes cases where Unity Objects in a Memory Snapshot might have pointed at invalid data for their Managed Shell, which may have been most notable with MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject types. This may also have fixed a vanishingly small amount of instances of reported "Leaked Managed Shell" objects where the Native Object part of the object got destroyed just after the managed Heap data was captured. The close timing makes the likelihood of all of these issues very rare and more likely the longer it takes to capture a snapshot. (UUM-77449)

### 2022.3.33f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Shadergraph: Added a new set of sample content - Production Ready Shaders - to the Shader Graph package.

#### API Changes

*   Editor: Added: Added helper functions to PackageInfo, to query the existence of packages, to optimize use cases that previously used GetAllRegisteredPackages.
    
*   Editor: Deprecated: Using XRSettings.enabled to enable/disable XR for an application is now deprecated in favor of calling Start()/Stop() on an XRDisplaySubystem instance.  
    Using XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName to load XR devices is now deprecated in favor of querying subsystem descriptors to create and start the subsystems of your choice with the SubystemManager. (UUM-30572)

### 2022.3.28f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Package Manager: Modifying assets located in immutable packages (under a project's Library/PackageCache folder) will no longer immediately re-resolve the project's packages, which can lead to faster iteration and allow temporary modification of those packages (for instance for testing or debugging purposes). Package Manager operations can still revert changes, so the recommended way to make changes permanent is still to embed packages prior to modifying them.

#### Changes

*   Android: New Google Play asset packs size and number limits. Unity generated asset packs now are always install-time. (UUM-68512)
    
*   Android: New Google Play base module size limit (200Mb). (UUM-67708)
    
*   Android: Updated bundletool up to 1.16.0. (UUM-70552)
    

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed Sprite preview where a small Sprite would have its pixels drawn inaccurately. ([UUM-68491](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/image-of-the-sprite-is-not-accurate-when-previewing-it-in-the-inspector-window))
    
*   2D: Fixed undo for GridSelection where undoing/redoing does not restore a GridSelection properly. ([UUM-70084](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tile-paint-action-disappears-from-undo-history-when-tile-selection-tool-has-been-used-beforehand))
    
*   Android: Fixed logic for overriding builtin java file, Unity will also now respect package name inside java file. Previously the logic was driven only by java file name. ([UUM-67826](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-cannot-find-symbol-public-class-unityplayeractivity-extends-com-dot-unity3d-dot-player-dot-unityplayeractivity-error-is-thrown-when-building-for-the-android-platform))
    
*   Android: Fixed problem with overflow when validating size of AppBundle containing more than 2GB of install time data. (UUM-71024)
    
*   Apple TV: Fixed crash in UnityWebRequest when running on tvOS versions lower than 17. ([UUM-69946](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tvos-making-any-unitywebrequest-request-on-an-appletv-crashes-the-app-on-tvos-versions-below-17-dot-0))
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed issue where older assets referencing URP materials have missing asset preview thumbnails. ([UUM-41411](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-thumbnails-are-only-shown-when-the-prefabs-are-reimported))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Users are now allowed to save assets in any valid assets folder, which is not read-only. ([UUM-65305](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-error-message-is-displayed-when-any-type-of-file-is-saved-outside-the-projects-assets-folder))
    
*   Audio: Fixed AudioMixer.SetFloat not working correctly on assets loaded from an asset bundle in play mode in the editor. ([UUM-68181](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-mixer-does-not-change-volume-when-lowering-volume-on-an-audio-mixer-loaded-from-assetbundles))
    
*   Core: Fixed errors when using baked gi node on builtin. ([UUM-70376](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-errors-are-thrown-when-using-baked-gi-node-within-the-shader-graph))
    
*   Documentation: Updated the PrefabUtility.IsPartOfxxx documentation. (UUM-56678)
    
*   Editor: Fixed a crash caused by shader variant collection (SVC) shaders with dynamic branching when entering play mode.

*   Editor: When a user removes a TerrainCollider component from a Terrain object, there are no longer MissingComponentExceptions thrown every frame. Instead, it is replaced with a warning in the inspector for every tool that involves painting (Paint Terrain, Paint Trees, Paint Details). The warning message also includes a button that allows the user to easily add/enable the TerrainCollider component. ([UUM-67250](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/missingcomponentexception-errors-are-thrown-when-using-terrain-with-no-terrain-collider))
    
*   Editor: \[Android\] Fixed float parsing and serializing for maxAspectRatio attribute by using InvariantCulture to avoid build failure on 2022.3 when system language is French and Aspect Ratio Mode is not Native. ([UUM-68607](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-android-build-fails-with-an-error-system-dot-formatexception-input-string-was-not-in-a-correct-format-dot-when-aspect-ratio-mode-is-set-to-other-than-native-aspect-ratio-and-windows-language-is-set-to-french-france))

*   HDRP: Added framesettings to render volumetric clouds in half res to reduce jittering. (UUM-61438)
    
*   HDRP: Regenerate the hlsl include that where out of date. ([UUM-70083](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-pregenerated-lightdefinition-dot-cs-dot-hlsl-does-not-match-the-source-lightdefinition-dot-cs-when-regenerating-shader-includes))
    
*   macOS: Fixed mouse button stuck pressed when focusing window with mouse using Input System. ([UUM-69724](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/new-input-system-registers-mouse-down-events-when-clicking-or-dragging-the-title-bar-of-the-windowed-player-window-with-locked-cursor-on-macos))
    
*   Package Manager: Exclude PackageManager folder from `..\ProjectTemplates\libcache\..`.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where adding packages could fail with the error message "Converting circular structure to JSON". (UUM-63996)
    
*   Particles: Enforced that a particle system using prewarm does nothing when calling Play from script, if it was already playing, as described by the documentation. ([UUM-69074](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/currently-playing-particles-disappear-and-start-playing-again-when-the-particlesystem-dot-play-method-is-called))
    
*   Prefabs: Ensure AddedGameObjects re-parented correctly in broken scenes where they already have a parent. ([UUM-58305](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-block-remove-when-a-scene-is-opened-in-a-specific-project))
    
*   Scene/Game View: Fixed Gizmo disappearing when selecting nested prefabs. ([UUM-67501](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/reflection-probe-gizmo-disappears-when-selecting-nested-prefabs))
    
*   Scripting: TransformAccess.GetLocalPositionAndRotation() now returns the correct results. ([UUM-62533](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/wrong-position-and-rotation-values-are-returned-when-using-transformaccess-dot-getlocalpositionandrotation))
    
*   Serialization: Crash on SerializedProperty:CopyInternalImpl when clicking on a specific Asset. ([UUM-68293](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-serializedproperty-copyinternalimpl-when-clicking-on-a-specific-asset))
    
*   uGUI: Fixed the Canvas inspector not allowing all possible choices of the "Additional Shader Channels" property. ([UUM-64603](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cannot-toggle-normal-or-tangent-when-selecting-in-additional-shader-channels-dropdown))

*   VFX Graph: Fixed missing outputs in Transform operator (and many other nodes with sub-properties). ([UUM-70986](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vfx-missing-expand-option-with-output-slot))
    
*   WebGL: Refactored code to have a more robust replacement operation when assembling the framework js file. To achieve this the `String.Replace` operation was set back to a `Regex.Replace`. To account for special characters and regex that may be present in the user jspre code (see UUM-21896), the final parameter uses a anonymous delegate function to treat the replacement string as a string literal so that it is not processed in any way. ([UUM-67705](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/jspre-files-are-not-included-when-building-for-webgl))

*   Burst: If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted. In order to fix this ( editor only - player builds are unaffected), we now save some additional context on each entry point.
    
*   Editor: Context menus in transient search now respect light mode themes on macOS. ([UUM-59378](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/contextual-menu-the-same-menu-in-different-windows-is-presented-in-different-colors))

*   Editor: Global Settings will always be ensured no matter what RP is active. (UUM-47264)
    
*   Editor: Increased VisionOS Metal RuntimeVersion to 7 (should enable tessellation).
    
*   Editor: Linux CheckedMenu submenu items not displaying as Checked in some occasions. (UUM-58878)
    
*   Editor: Opening a context menu on macOS will now focus the application so all functions in the hierarchy work. ([UUM-26081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-context-menu-in-hierarchy-is-available-but-not-functional-when-the-editor-is-out-of-focus))
    
*   Editor: Printing proper message into console when compiling mesh data optimization processing to avoid confusing logs. ([UUM-54590](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/variant-count-after-stripping-is-increased-for-the-first-build-after-shader-keyword-changes))
    
*   Editor: Some visionOS builds will no longer fail with an inability to execute process\_symbols.sh.
    
*   GI: Fixed crash on Apple Silicon in llvm::VectorType::get when opening a specific project. ([UUM-59133](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/silicon-crash-on-llvm-vectortype-get-when-opening-a-specific-project))
    
*   Graphics: Clarify RenderTexture creation error wording to use "volumeDepth" instead of "depth". (UUM-59895)
    
*   Graphics: DrawProceduralNow family of functions also provide emulated vertexbuffers. (UUM-51751)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed missed samplerCubeArrayShadow texture binding when processing GLSLang reflection. ([UUM-59188](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-vertex-program-vert-unrecognized-sampler-error-occurs-when-compiling-shader-with-vulkan-api))
    
*   Graphics: Ignore volumeDepth during RenderTexture creation validation for texture dimensions Texture2D and Cubemap as noted in the API documentation. ([UUM-60005](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rendertexture-dot-create-fails-when-texture-is-2d-but-depth-is-set-to-a-non-default-value-default-is-1))
    
*   Graphics: Surface shader path has correct parameters set when emulating vertexbuffers. ([UUM-52930](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/graphics-dot-renderprimitives-does-not-work-when-using-surface-shaders))
    
*   Graphics: When using CaptureScreenshotAsTexture during the rendering process with Metal API, if the results are undefined then Unity now outputs an error instead of crashing. (UUM-47096)
    
*   HDRP: Async compute Presents issues when depending on the first texture read of depth. In some platforms (vulkan/dx12 and some consoles) the first read of depth is actually a write because of decompression / layout / barriers.  
    Async compute is inserting the fence before this operation because RenderGraph sees everything as a simple Read / Write.  
    Temporarily hacking this so the first read of depth is tagged as a write, so the correct fence is inserted. (UUM-57601)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed incorrect shadows rendering in player. ([UUM-7816](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-wrong-material-variant-picked-in-player))

*   IL2CPP: Fixed conversion errors on constrained calls in shared generic code. (UUM-55756)
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed crash when calling Type.IsGenericTypeParameter and Type.IsGenericMethodParameter. ([UUM-56064](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-type-get-isgenerictypeparameter-m64b33ca8a518c68b58352ce3d66c2b0774292c4c-when-calling-isgenerictypeparameter-on-unbound-generic-types-in-il2cpp-player))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed null value on P/Invoke method with an \[Out\] marshalled blittable class parameter. ([UUM-57901](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-player-crash-on-memset-in-vcruntime140d-when-selecting-ui-gameobject))
    
*   Linux: Fixed CursorLockMode.Confined does not confine cursor when using multiple displays. ([UUM-57233](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-cursorlockmode-dot-confined-does-not-confine-cursor-when-using-multiple-displays))

*   Player: Fixed incorrect shadows rendering in player. ([UUM-25408](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadows-alpha-clipping-is-ignored-and-shadows-rendered-without-details-in-player))
    
*   Profiler: Fixed an issue whereby all Rendering statistics could be zero in Play Mode when the application's target frame rate was set. ([UUM-58128](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-rendering-profiler-module-statistics-are-zero-when-application-dot-targetframerate-is-set))
    
*   Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where continuously panning an orthographic SceneView camera would eventually cause the rendered geometry to be clipped. ([UUM-56425](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/panning-to-sides-causes-the-camera-clipping-a-gameobject-in-scene-view-when-the-scene-is-viewed-from-the-top-and-is-in-orthographic-projection-mode))

*   Shaders: Added \_KEYWORD\_DECLARED define for each shader keyword so that it is possible to select code sections based on the keyword presence. ([UUM-59203](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dynamic-branching-shader-code-cant-be-shared-with-passes-that-dont-declare-the-keywords))
    
*   Shaders: Ensures internal shader compiler errors such as losing connection to a compiler process aren't cached like compilation errors are. (UUM-28802)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed an incorrect warning being shown when doing paired calls to SetAsyncCompilation / RestoreAsyncCompilation on RenderingCommandBuffer.

#### Changes

*   Editor: Added visionOS icons for build target selection and player settings.

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed AnimatedTile not animating in a player build. (UUM-55931)
    
*   2D: Fixed case where URP freeform lights glitch when Light points are close to one another. ([UUM-43318](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-freeform-lights-glitch-when-light-points-are-close-to-one-another))

    *   The reasoning for blending again with the history when alpha is 0 is because we want the color to blend a bit with opacity, which is the main reason for the alpha values. sort of like a precomputed color  
        
    *   As a safety, we set the color to black if alpha is 0. This results in better image quality when alpha is enabled. ([UUM-33950](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/anti-aliasing-around-objects-results-in-outlines-when-recording-against-a-background))
