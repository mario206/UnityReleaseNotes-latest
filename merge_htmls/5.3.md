Revision: c347874230fb

### Improvements

*   Android: Symbols for release libraries are now available in PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/Variantions/\*/Release/Symbols.
*   Audio: Added ability to transition AudioMixer snapshots by scaled and unscaled time.
*   Audio: Added virtualization of audio effects. For audio sources that are virtual because they have been culled due to low audibility or priority, attached effect components or spatializers are now also bypassed in order to save CPU use. The new behaviour is on by default, but can be turned off in the audio project settings.
*   Audio: Audio clip waveform preview now displays the actual format used for compression when the default format isnât available on a certain platform.
*   Audio: Audio clips with the "Streaming" load type are no longer preloaded. This is done to reduce the number of open file handles in scenes referencing a large number of streamed clips. The behaviour is not affected except for a slight increase in playback delay of this type of audio clips.
*   Audio: Fixed audio clip waveform preview rendering sync issues after import, and improved the way the waveforms are being rendered to be more dynamic and reveal more detail.
*   Audio: Moved Preload Audio Data to the platform-specific settings section. The previous location was confusing as it was shown grayed-out in the inspector with a checkmark that depended on all overrides.
*   Audio: SystemInfo now includes supportsAudio info.
*   GI: Added a version number to the Lighting Data asset. Give the user a nice error message if their Lighting Data is out of date.
*   Graphics: Documentation for Display API.
*   iOS: Update Build and Run to work with Xcode 8
*   Lighting: Improved an error message about invalid data when baking probes.
*   Runtime-Other: Added diagnostic option to cmdline arguments -debugallocator \[1/2\] which helps to identify memory access issues in the engine on Windows and OSX x64 platforms.
*   Runtime: During crashes even if the stack walking is aborted with error (RtlLookupFunctionEntry returned NULL function. Aborting stack walk), Unity will display stripped stack trace instead of displaying zero stack frames.
*   Shaders: Removed an outdated comment in UnityStandardCore.cginc
*   VR: Updated to Oculus Version 1.5.
*   VR: Updated to version 1.4 of the Oculus API.
*   WebSocket: Improved memory allocation and socket writing procedure (fixed not expected connection closing)
*   Windows Store: Expanded UnityEngine.WSA.Cursor.SetCustomCursor, if you pass 0 to this function, it will restore the cursor to arror icon. (791792)
*   Windows Store: Improved 'NULL != certificate' errors, it will now provide a human readable message why it failed to create a certificate. (792507)

### Fixes

Revision: 29055738eb78

### Improvements

*   Android: IL2CPP - Stripping of symbols and debug info is now enabled by default. Development builds still have symbols which makes for a slightly larger binary.
*   Asset Bundles: Added offset argument to AssetBundle.CreateFromFile and AssetBundle.LoadFromFile methods.
*   Asset Bundles: Output the CRC value for the manifest asset bundle.
*   Asset Management: Introduced AssetDatabase.GetAssetDependencyHash method which returns the hash of all the dependencies of an asset.
*   Cluster Rendering: Improved cluster networking layer and reduced instability while using cluster input.
*   Graphics: Dynamic batching was reintroduced for particles, lines and trails. (766802)
*   IL2CPP: Reduce the binary size and build time for projects which make use of many C# attributes.
*   iOS: Added a compile flag in the trampoline code in order to allow disable the filtering of emoji characters.
*   iOS: Added device support for iPhone SE and iPad Pro 9.7".
*   OpenGL: ComputeBuffer now uses the same data layout as Direct3D whenever automatically translated shaders are used. Therefore no more special layout handling for ComputeBuffer.SetData/GetData is needed based on the graphics API and any such user code should be removed. The only exception is with manually written GLSL shaders. In that case the OpenGL data layout rules must be taken into account.
*   Networking: Added support for IPv6 networks in UdpClient. (767741)
*   VR: Updated Oculus API and plugin to version 1.3.2. Downloading 1.3.2 OVRPlugin from Oculus is no longer necessary.
*   Windows Store: On IL2CPP scripting backend, Unity players are now shipped as DLLs rather than static libraries. This significantly reduces platform support module installation size as well as decreases generated C++ code linking time.

### Changes

*   Android: IL2CPP - Full debug version of IL2CPP libraries are stored in Temp/StagingArea/Il2Cpp/Native.
*   OpenGL: ComputeBuffer data layout changes to match Direct3D; see Improvements section for details.
*   Installer: Updated EULA.

Revision: fdbb5133b820

### Improvements

*   GI: Optimized GISceneManager.Update in order to take less processor time on scene start (769044).
