### 2019.4.40f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Asset Pipeline: Accelerator Corruption Detection.

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed 'require texture compression' setting being reset during player build. ([1397965](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-size-increased-on-first-build-when-compress-textures-slash-assets-on-import-is-enabled))
    
*   AI: Fixed unidirectional NavMesh links creating erroneous connection between polygons. ([1328727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unidirectional-navmeshlink-results-in-navmeshagents-pathing-incorrectly))
    
*   Android: Fixed a Unity Audio bug related to Bluetooth audio. This was causing issues with Vivox, and possibly other 3rd part audio libraries, with Bluetooth functionality. On Android, Bluetooth audio state is basically global, so Unity Audio now only makes the bare minimum changes to this state. We may still call startBluetoothSco and stopBluetoothSco when starting or re-initializing the audio output engine and when starting/stopping the Unity microphone. We may also call AudioManager.setMode when starting/stopping a Bluetooth mic through the Unity microphone APIs, but that's it. (1418634)
    
*   Android: Fixed app-freezing when an application changes into multi-window(split-screen) on Chrome OS tablet mode. (1361131)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where MonoScripts in plugins that were dependent on plugins in other folders could fail to import when reimporting all assets. ([1411256](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scripts-are-missing-after-importing-a-custom-package))

*   Audio: Fixed an issue that the Windows Editor no longer tries to link with the MP3 LAME library, which it does not use directly.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where cached Sprite state could be stale.
    
*   DX12: Fixed an issue to offset binding support for cbuffers disabled from SystemInfo on DX12 as it has never been supported. ([1381731](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/painting-terrain-details-result-in-a-crash-when-using-directx12))
    
*   Editor: Fixed IMGUI state being reset when a EditorUtility.DisplayDialog was opened. ([1380288](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-exception-after-calling-editorutility-dot-displaydialog-from-reorderablelist-item-propertydrawer))
    
*   Editor: Fixed reflection probe baking sometimes containing the cyan loading shader. ([1368213](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/loading-shader-is-picked-when-allowasynccompilation-equals-false-and-async-compilation-is-ongoing))
    
*   GI: Fixed an issue that the light probe now produces valid output when punctual light overlaps it. ([1242829](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/point-lights-have-no-guard-when-light-probes-are-near-or-overlapping-them-in-progressive-lightmapper))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed hang on repeated calls to GraphicsBuffer.CopyCount. ([1353308](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-with-graphicsbuffer-dot-copycount-on-dx11-with-intel-integrated-graphics))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed incompatible render pass validation error in built-in pipeline project when graphics API is set to Vulkan. (1355666)

*   Input: Fixed keyboard not working on iOS 15. ([1376970](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/keyboard-input-is-not-working-when-using-an-external-keyboard-in-ios-15))
    
*   Input: Fixed keys being stuck pressed when application regains focus on Windows Standalone, macOS with input system package. ([1361145](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ispressed-keeps-returning-true-when-it-was-true-before-minimizing-the-build-window))
    
*   Input: Fixed mouse coordinates being incorrect until first move on Windows Standalone, Linux, macOS with input system package. ([1231907](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mouse-coordinates-reported-as-00-until-the-first-move))

*   iOS: Fixed a bug with the "Force iOS Speakers when Recording" player setting. In addition, a few other iOS Bluetooth audio bugs were fixed. When starting up with Bluetooth headphones connected, audio output used to play through the built-in speakers (which was an error). The list of available microphones was not always correct when connecting / dis-connecting Bluetooth headphones at runtime. Bluetooth microphone input was really choppy. ([1387403](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sound-is-playing-through-the-ear-speaker-if-using-force-ios-speakers-when-recording-when-prepare-ios-for-recording-is-on))

*   Input System: Fixed current being `null` for sensors (`Accelerometer.current`, others). ([1371204](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/accelerometer-not-working-when-using-input-system-1-dot-1-1))

*   Input System: Fixed `action.ReadValue` and others returning invalid data when used from `FixedUpdate` or early update when running in play mode in the editor. ([1368559](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/enter-key-is-not-registered-when-using-waspressedthisframe-with-input-system-1-dot-1-1))
    
*   Input System: Improved the user experience when creating single vs multi-touch touchscreen bindings in the Input Action Asset editor by making both options visible in the input action dropdown menu. Now it's not neccessary to be aware of the touch\\\*/press path binding syntax. ([1357664](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-touchscreens-multi-touch-doesnt-work-when-using-a-custom-inputactionasset))

*   Serialization: Fixed missed invocations of ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialization and asserts arising when that interface is implemented on structs inside a MonoBehaviour or ScriptableObject class, along with the presence of SerializeReference fields. ([1372710](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-error-is-thrown-when-calling-resources-dot-loadall-together-with-linq-expressions))

*   Profiler: Added missing memory labels sizes to the memory snapshot format, in order to give real value to the prexisting label list. Api for access this data will be found inside the memory profiler package
    
*   Profiler: Added profiler memory stats data, data is similar to the Profiler Module data found in the Profiler Window
    
*   Profiler: Added profiler target data to memory snapshot format, data consists of elements such as unity version, product name, total gfx memory, total physical memory etc.
    
*   Profiler: Encoded managed heap section type inside the snapshot format, for retrieval via the memory profiler package

### 2019.4.23f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Graphics: Added support for importing 16bit per channel integer formats without quantization. This also exposed new TextureFormats R16G16, R16G16B16 & R16G16B16A16.

#### Improvements

*   Graphics: Improved the application of outstanding pending changes to RendererScene after a camera render.
    
*   Scripting: Added support for Unity Version Defines in Assembly definition import options.  
    This feature improvement allows scripts to easily specify different code snippets for different Unity version ranges. This is especially useful for introducing calls to newly added public APIs, in which case these API calls needs to be guarded by defines based on a Unity version range of a given Unity version or later.  
    Unity version range expression syntax is the same as package version range expressions. Unity version format differs from package version format, thus Unity version expressions are evaluated based on some rules specific to the Unity version format:
    
    *   Comparison of release types follows the following rules: a<b<f=c<p<x. So e.g. an alpha version is always smaller (earlier) than a beta version, regardless of the incremental version.
        
    *   The Unity versions are allowed to have suffixes (e.g 2020.1.3-acme) which are ignored by the Unity version comparison code.
        
    *   Chinese releases are equivalent to public releases (f) so for the sake of comparison in the version range expression 2020.1f3 would be equal to 2020.1c3
        
    *   Experimental releases don't include an incremental version - e.g. everything after 2020.2.1x would be treated as suffix and ignored by the version comparison.
        

#### API Changes

*   Graphics: Added: Added new SystemInfo.supportsStoreAndResolveAction API to check for StoreAndResolveAction store action support on a specific platform.

#### Changes

*   Graphics: Updated postprocessing package to 3.0.3.
    
*   Graphics: Updated postprocessing package to 3.1.0.
    
*   Package: Updated com.unity.purchasing version to 3.0.1.

*   Scripting: Fixed issue where thread statics that reused thread static slots would not adhere to type alignment. This would cause the garbage collector to incorrectly clean up thread static data because it would only scan pointer aligned memory for references. This would lead to memory becoming corrupted and inducing random crashes. ([1266322](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mono-class-fill-runtime-generic-context-when-entering-play-mode-repeatedly))

*   Video: Fixed to crash when destroying VideoPlayer while it is still initializing. (1241848)
    
*   WebGL: Fixed WebGL build issue when the default system Python version is Python3 instead of Python2. (1280386)
    
*   XR: Backport trunk fix to 2019.4. Utilize volume up and down buttons on VR devices to confirm and proceed when Android dialog is not visible on VR devices instead of only restricting to click "Ok" button on screen. ([1140155](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/oculus-go-managed-debugger-dialog-cannot-be-interacted-with-when-launching-the-application))
    
*   XR: Correct mismatched Vulkan framebuffer and renderpass configurations that caused validation errors, and issues with rendering when using multiple rendering passes.
    
*   XR: Fixed an issue where the XR splash screen is missing when using SRP. ([1230976](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-xrsdk-oculus-go-oculus-quest-virtual-reality-splash-image-doesnt-show-up-with-new-xr-sdk))
    
*   XR: Fixed Hololens 2 apps pausing when carry along apps are open.
    
*   XR: Fixed issue when using deferred rendering and stereo multipass where if the spotlight intersected the camera near and camera far planes then the spotlight would render incorrectly in the right eye.

*   XR: Fixed issue where attempting to use separate cameras while using stereo multipass to render each eye caused the left eye to render the right eye and the right eye to not render at all. ([1280266](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-mockhmd-lefteye-isnt-rendered-correctly-when-stereo-camera-is-separated-to-left-slash-right-with-multipass-rendering))
    
*   XR: Fixed stereo skybox rendering when a sphere is used instead of a cube. ([1223567](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-skybox-skybox-rendering-does-not-respect-far-plane-setting-occluding-the-scene-object-in-xr))
    

#### API Changes

*   Physics: Added: Added writeable WheelCollider.sprungMass, to enable explicit mass distributions. In addition to that, expose WheelCollider.ResetSprungMasses() to reset the vehicle back to automatically calculated implicit sprung masses. It's the same usage pattern as with Rigidbody.inertiaTensor / Rigidbody.ResetInertiaTensor().

#### Changes

*   Package Manager: Temporarily removed the Burst compiler warning about exception throws not in \[Conditional("ENABLE\_UNITY\_COLLECTIONS\_CHECKS")\] methods, to let us address user feedback. The next minor version of Burst will reincorporate this in a more friendly manner.

#### Improvements

*   IL2CPP: Improved error message when required Visual Studio components are not installed when building for Windows.
