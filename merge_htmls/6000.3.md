*   UI Toolkit: UI Toolkit: Fixed painter2D Fill() not rendering for shapes with extreme aspect ratios (e.g 36000x36).
    
*   URP: \[Editor\] Added optional terrain shader inclusion setting in URP Graphics settings. Unchecking it will prevent terrain detail shaders from being added to the build. ([UUM-109540](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-terrain-shaders-are-always-included-when-building-on-any-target-platform))
    
*   VFX Graph: Fixed an issue where branching on curve and gradient caused some unseless rebaking and upload to GPU. (UUM-129743)
    
*   WebGL: WebGPU: automatically handle textures that are bound to a shader for both read and write. ([UUM-131864](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgpu-cant-bind-compute-rwtexture-for-read-and-write))
    
*   WebGL: WebGPU: fix pipeline errors using RWTexture2D textures in shaders and simplify the use of unorm RWTextures. ([UUM-131863](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgpu-errors-with-unorm-and-half4-rwtexture))

### 6000.3.1f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   AI: Improved the performance of sampling the nearest position on the NavMesh. (UUM-117415)
    
*   Editor: Added a _New Nodes Preview_ button to the Shader Graph preferences to add nodes with an expanded preview.
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue where the progress bar was unresponsive when selecting the _Compile and show code_ dropdown menu in the _Shader Inspector_ window. ([UUM-97524](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/loading-time-and-the-number-of-shader-variants-highly-increase-when-using-a-lit-shader-graph-and-clicking-the-pop-up-menu-of-the-compile-and-show-code))
    
*   Editor: Increased the minimum width of the Sprite Editor window. When undocked, the window can no longer be resized to a width that hides buttons on the toolbar. (UUM-127566)
    
*   iOS: Added a workaround for an issue where Metal `CADisplayLink` callbacks were called recursively on some devices. This occurred when plugins loaded WebKit via `NSAttributedString initWithData:options:documentAttributes:error:` during the Unity player loop.
    
*   Linux: Updated the Linux toolchain to improve package handling.
    
*   Physics: Added settings to control how often the Physics system deallocated internal collision, trigger, and joint event buffers. This reduces memory pressure during a physics scene's preparation stage. You can find these settings at _Project Settings_ > _Physics_ > _Settings_ > _GameObjects_, under the _Release Simulation Buffers_ section. ([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))
    

#### API Changes

([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))
    
*   Scripting: Added: - Added the `HierarchyFlattened.AsReadOnlySpan` method to retrieve flattened nodes as a read-only span.  
    
    *   Added the `HierarchyViewModel.AsReadOnlySpan` method to retrieve nodes from a hierarchy view model as a read-only span.  
        
    *   Added the `HierarchyViewModel.FlagsChanged` event, which is invoked whenever flags changed.  
        
    *   Added the `HierarchyViewModel.EndFlagsChangeWithoutNotify` method to end a flags change scope without invoking the `FlagsChanged` event.
*   Scripting: Changed: - Modified the `EndFlagsChange` method to return which flags changed, if any.  
    
    *   Added a constructor parameter to the `HierarchyViewModelFlagsChangeScope` struct to choose whether the `FlagsChanged` event is invoked at the end.

#### Changes

*   iOS: Added support to pause and unpause DisplayLink when the application moved to the background or foreground.
    
*   iOS: Changed how the application presented frames to improve robustness.
