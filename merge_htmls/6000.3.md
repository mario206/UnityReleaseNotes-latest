### 6000.3.1f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   AI: Improved the performance of sampling the nearest position on the NavMesh. (UUM-117415)

([UUM-97524](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/loading-time-and-the-number-of-shader-variants-highly-increase-when-using-a-lit-shader-graph-and-clicking-the-pop-up-menu-of-the-compile-and-show-code))

*   iOS: Added a workaround for an issue where Metal `CADisplayLink` callbacks were called recursively on some devices. This occurred when plugins loaded WebKit via `NSAttributedString initWithData:options:documentAttributes:error:` during the Unity player loop.
    
*   Linux: Updated the Linux toolchain to improve package handling.
    
*   Physics: Added settings to control how often the Physics system deallocated internal collision, trigger, and joint event buffers. This reduces memory pressure during a physics scene's preparation stage. You can find these settings at _Project Settings_ > _Physics_ > _Settings_ > _GameObjects_, under the _Release Simulation Buffers_ section. ([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))

([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))
    
*   Scripting: Added: - Added the `HierarchyFlattened.AsReadOnlySpan` method to retrieve flattened nodes as a read-only span.  
    
    *   Added the `HierarchyViewModel.AsReadOnlySpan` method to retrieve nodes from a hierarchy view model as a read-only span.  
        
    *   Added the `HierarchyViewModel.FlagsChanged` event, which is invoked whenever flags changed.  
        
    *   Added the `HierarchyViewModel.EndFlagsChangeWithoutNotify` method to end a flags change scope without invoking the `FlagsChanged` event.
*   Scripting: Changed: - Modified the `EndFlagsChange` method to return which flags changed, if any.  
    
    *   Added a constructor parameter to the `HierarchyViewModelFlagsChangeScope` struct to choose whether the `FlagsChanged` event is invoked at the end.

#### Changes

*   iOS: Added support to pause and unpause DisplayLink when the application moved to the background or foreground.
    
*   iOS: Changed how the application presented frames to improve robustness.
