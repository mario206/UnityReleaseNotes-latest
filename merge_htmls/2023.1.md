### 2023.1.1f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Test Framework: Added TestFileReferences.json to be generated on build step of the player, so can be consumed later by Test runners to enrich data for run part.
    
*   Test Framework: By using the editor command line new argument -randomOrderSeed x you can run the tests in a randomized order, where x is an integer different from 0. If a new test is added in the project the random order passing the same seed will be kept, and the new test will be placed in the random list accordigly.
    
*   Test Framework: The UTF version now automatically updates for SRP tests

*   Serialization: It is not possible to instantiate abstract class, which is happening in this case. The fix for editor crash is to make sure that the abstract StatusEffect class is not instantiated in SerializedReference fields. You can achieve this by either changing all the occurrences, or add \[MovedFrom(true, sourceClassName:"StatusEffect")\] attribute to StatusEffectComplex class. ([UUM-9218](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-with-the-file-memorystream-is-corrupted-when-opening-a-scene))
    
*   Serialization: When serializing empty managed object reference we are not adding the data node in the YAML, which is causing problems after some fields are added to the script and the YAML is being de-serialized. In this case, as there still is not any data node in the YAML, the deserialization process is not instantiating the managed object correctly. ([UUM-2258](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/changes-to-an-empty-serializereference-class-causes-data-errorswhen-selecting-a-previously-created-asset))

*   Shaders: Fixed progress bar sometimes not appearing when "Compile and show code" button is pressed in the shader inspector. ([UUM-27865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-compilation-stuck-on-0-slash-6144-variants-ready-when-trying-to-compile-a-shader))
    
*   Test Framework: Fix for WebGL platform target to close the browser tab when the run is completed.
    
*   TextCore: Corrected the improper ratio between character spacing and word spacing for justified alignment. We intend to introduce an adjustable property to allow for fine-tuning of this ratio. ([UUM-30367](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-toolkit-spaces-between-letters-are-too-big-when-using-align-equals-justified-tag))
    
*   TextCore: Ensure <voffset> tag affects the preferred height values. ([UUM-28446](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/voffset-text-inside-label-goes-out-of-label-bounds-when-visualelement-is-resized))

([UUM-12865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rendered-textures-overlay-ui-has-a-different-size-compared-to-the-rendered-texture-in-the-scene-view))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed issue where sprites used incorrect indexes. ([UUM-30797](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprites-with-different-indexes-than-indicated-in-text-field-of-label-inspector-are-being-rendered))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed selection when the carriage return (\\r) is being used. ([UUM-8181](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-select-all-text-when-using-slash-r-escape-character))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed UI Toolkit not rendering in render texture when launched in batch mode. ([UUM-26763](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-toolkit-is-not-rendered-when-the-player-is-launched-in-batch-mode))
    
*   URP: Fixed redundant blit is used due to postFX, although it is disabled in rendererData. ([UUM-31474](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/quest-urp-enabling-post-processing-on-a-camera-when-its-disabled-on-the-urp-settings-forces-rendering-into-an-intermediate-texture))

*   WebGL: - Fixed webCamTexture.DidUpdateThisFrame not getting correctly updated ([UUM-29274](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webcamtexture-dot-didupdatethisframe-returns-true-only-for-the-first-frame-when-the-project-is-built-for-webgl))
    
*   Windows: Fixed a bug with multi-channel audio input on Windows. If we tried to capture from a microphone with more than 2 channels, Microphone.Start would fail and an "Unsupported file or audio format" error would appear in the console. (UUM-26565)

*   Editor: For URP and HDRP moved the Realtime GI CPU Usage setting to the Quality tab in Project Settings. ([UUM-28789](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/quality-settings-missing-cpu-usage-setting-users-unable-to-tune-realtime-gi-performance))
    
*   Graphics: Avoid false warnings about RenderTexture format when switching colorspace. (UUM-6770)

    _First seen in 2023.1.0b3._
    
*   HDRP: Added check to ensure gismos arent rendered when they shouldnt be. ([UUM-22315](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gizmos-are-visible-when-disabled-in-wireframe-shading-mode-with-hdrp))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed cloud layer rotation does not allow for smooth rotation. ([UUM-35087](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-hdrp-cloud-rotation-does-not-allow-for-smooth-rotation-at-low-rotation-speeds))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed GetScaledSize when not using scaling. (UUM-34513)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed quad overdraw debug at high resolution. (UUM-33220)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed TAA aliasing edge issues on alpha output for recorder / green screen. This fix does the following:  
    
    *   Removes history rejection when the current alpha value is 0. Instead it does blend with the history color when alpha value is 0 on the current plane.  
        
    *   The reasoning for blending again with the history when alpha is 0 is because we want the color to blend a bit with opacity, which is the main reason for the alpha values. sort of like a precomputed color  
        
    *   As a safety, we set the color to black if alpha is 0. This results in better image quality when alpha is enabled. ([UUM-33950](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/anti-aliasing-around-objects-results-in-outlines-when-recording-against-a-background))
*   HDRP: Fixed VT init to avoid RTHandle allocation outside of HDRP rendering loop. (UUM-31058)
    
*   HDRP: Upgrading from DLSS 2.4 to DLSS 3.0 for upscaling part. (UUM-36246)
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed LineNumberMapping.json not ending up in exported projects when --emit-source-mapping is used. ([UUM-29964](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-no-c-number-to-c-plus-plus-line-mapping-json-file-present-when-exporting-android-project))
