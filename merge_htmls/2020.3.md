See the scripting documentation for Object.FindObjectsByType() and Object.FindObjectsOfType() for more details.
    
*   Version Control: Removed: Collab and its dependency from the package.

### 2020.3.30f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Asset Pipeline: Logging done in imports run in an import worker is now forwarded to the main editor log.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Logging in import worker will now always log to local import worker log file.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Added an API to gather the lighting and fog modes used by the active scene.
    
*   Editor: Added a new API InternalEditorUtility.LoadSerializedFileAndForgetAsync which loads a serialized file on the preload thread.
    
*   Profiler: Added Profiler.EmitSessionMetaData api to pass generic metadata to the Profiler associated with profiling session.
    
*   Scene Manager: Added Developer-only toggle to view Preview Scenes on the hierarchy for debugging purposes.
    
*   Scene Manager: Added flags to support certain GameObject features in Preview Scenes (Events, GI Lights and Cameras).
    
*   Scripting: Added a new AsyncReadManager FileInfo() API to check for a file's existence and (if present) the file size.
    
*   Scripting: Added atomic safety handle boolean validation functions to AtomicSafetyHandle.bindings.cs
    

#### Fixes

*   Editor: Fixed incorrect JobsDebugger handling of C# "readonly" keyword.
    
*   Scripting: Fixed: Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadStatus.Truncated result for completion of a truncated read. A truncated read occurs when an asynchronous file request attempts to read beyond the end of a file.
    
*   Scripting: Fixed: Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadStatusExtension methods - Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadStatusExtension.Complete() returns true on successful completion regardless of truncated file reads.
    
*   Scripting: Updated NativeArray and NativeSlice Enumerator MoveNext functions with a define conditional atomic safety handle boolean check to ensure that existing enumerators return false when MoveNext() is called instead of throwing an exception.

### 2020.3.16f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Package: ProBuilder 4.5.2

#### Improvements

*   Android: Bump Android Logcat package to 1.2.3
    
*   Graphics: Improvements to scene culling CPU performance - Shadow casters are rejected earlier if their shadow casting is disabled which should improve performance in scenes with scenes with lots of renderable objects that are set to not cast shadows. (1322874)
    
*   Graphics: VFX : Optimization while sending event to a VisualEffect by script
    
*   iOS: Improve logging in iOS automation: clarify existing log messages and add new ones.

*   Prefabs: optimized Prefab->UnpackCompletely by up to 10x (1253178)
    
*   Package Manager: The Package Manager's global cache root folder, which is used to store downloaded packages, can now be configured using the `UPM_CACHE_ROOT` environment variable or the `cacheRoot` key in the user configuration file.
    

#### API Changes

*   Asset Pipeline: Added: Added AssetDatabase.SaveAssetIfDirty() to save individual assets if required.
    
*   Graphics: Added: A new API for compiling shaders from editor code and obtaining reflection info was added to ShaderData.Pass.
    
*   Physics: Added: Added a property for retrieving ArticulationBody components during a collision event. Articulation bodies can be retrieved by Collision.articulationBody
    
*   Physics: Added: Added a property for retrieving either ArticulationBody or Rigidbody components to collision events under Collision.body.
    

#### Changes

*   2D: Tile.StartUp is called after Tilemap is loaded instead of on the first Update after Tilemap is loaded. (1327583)
    
*   Android: Allow Android Player to use Vulkan on GPUs that are currently unknown to Unity on Android 11 or newer.
    
*   Burst: Platform updates.
