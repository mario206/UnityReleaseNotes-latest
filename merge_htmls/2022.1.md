### 2022.1.19f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Core: Added Transform.SetLocalPositionAndRotation(). This allows you to set both the localPosition and localRotation of a transform in a single call, which is more efficient than assigning to localPosition and localRotation separately. (Thank you to @DevDunk on the forum for the request!).
    
*   Shadergraph: Reduced time taken by code generation when a shader graph asset is imported.
    
*   VFX Graph: Reduced time taken by code generation when a VFX asset is imported.
    

#### Changes

*   Burst: ;'s in paths would cause burst to fail. Note - Also requires a fix in the Editor, so if your project has ;'s in its path, the workaround is to remove the ; from the folder name for now.
    
*   Burst: An Internal Compiler Error that could occur if a function that requires a struct ret (due to ABI) has been discarded by other logic.
    
*   Burst: Corrupted binary could be produced on M1 if there was not enough space for UUID+codesign injection.
    
*   Burst: Disabling Burst from the command line via `--burst-disable-compilation` no longer results in Burst errors when building a player for Android.

*   Burst: Fixed a bug where static fields in generic types could in some situations be initialized with the incorrect value.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug with locally declared array variables in functions where storing `null` into them could cause invalid codegen.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a safety check bug with `Span`/`ReadOnlySpan` and `Slice(start, length)` where if `start`
    
    *   `length` was equal to the `Length` of the original span, the safety check would incorrectly report an out-of-bounds access.
    
*   Burst: Fixed access violation race condition bug.
    
*   Burst: Fixed error that occurs with a specific formulation of IL, using xx with an early out escape and unbalanced calculation stack. (Object reference not set to an instance of ... in CollectBlock.ToVisitOrder).
    
*   Burst: Fixed error when compiling assemblies with spaces in their names.
    
*   Burst: Fixed that UWP builds wouldn't respect the specified "Target SDK Version" and "Visual Studio Version" settings.
    
*   Burst: Interface methods where not being hashed correctly for constrained types, which would result in burst failing to recompile code that had changed in an implementation class.
    
*   Burst: Linking issue when exports differ only by module.
    
*   Editor: Corrected the build of a Mac Standalone player with an exported Xcode project when script debugging is enabled. ([UUM-11352](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-xcode-build-fails-when-building-an-exported-project-with-script-debugging-enabled))

### 2022.1.6f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Burst: Added support for the `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsExternalInit` workaround documented \[here\]([https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html)) into Burst when used in 2022.1+.

#### Changes

*   Burst: Changed how we process static readonly fields in static constructors such that we'll allow more computational budget per static field. This fixes the case where having too many static readonly variables in a single static constructor could fail to compile, while they would work if each was in their own static constructors.
    
*   Burst: SDK Updates.
    

#### Fixes

*   Burst: Added workaround for "cannot dlopen until fork() handlers have completed" issue seen in macOS 12.3.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug that manifested when using IAP in UWP builds with Burst - we were scanning the assembly hierarchy too deep for Bursted types, which led to an `AssemblyResolutionException`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug with `Span` and `ReadOnlySpan` types where if the indices used were not already 32-bit signed integers, an internal compiler error would occur if running with safety checks enabled.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a compiler crash if users used `__refvalue` or `__arglist` in Burst. Neither of these are supported, but now we will nicely tell you via a compiler error that they aren't supported.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a compiler error when trying to acquire the function pointer of a generic function from Bursted code.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a really convoluted bug that could manifest in Burst returning out of date cached libraries, which would manifest as random exceptions in Burst jobs/function-pointers (users deleting the BurstCache would workaround the bug).
    
*   Burst: Fixed a regression where out parameters of C# 9.0 function pointers weren't working in Burst.
    
*   Burst: Fixed bug in static constructor ordering in the presence of indirect dependencies between static constructors (i.e. static constructor -> static method -> static constructor) that could result in a runtime crash.
    
*   Burst: Fixed bug where disabling native debug mode, after having previously enabled it in the same editor session, didn't in fact disable native debug mode.
    
*   Burst: Fixed burst inspector sometimes stalling during loading for script reloads.
    
*   Burst: Fixed compiler crash when the only usage of a static field was in a formatted exception string.
    
*   Burst: Fixed compiler crash when trying to dynamically call `BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer` in Burst-compiled code.
    
*   Burst: Fixed hashing bug that could occur when a function pointer type is used in a method parameter.
    
*   Burst: Fixed hashing error that could occur in the presence of multiple synthesized explicit interface implementations with the same name and signature.
    
*   Burst: Fixed internal compiler error when encountering a `calli` with closed generics.
    
*   Burst: Using a function only through a C# function pointer could cause a crash.
    
*   Editor: IndexOutOfRangeException is thrown when openning Object Picker. ([UUM-2825](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/backport-indexoutofrangeexception-is-thrown-when-triggering-showobjectpicker-in-a-custom-node-graph))
    
*   GI: The editor could crash in case of overlapping light probes when additively loaded scenes. This fix eliminates an attempt to deduplicate light probes with respect to positions. A warning is introduced as the lack of deduplication could cause flickering objects.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed consistent Gfx.WaitForPresentOnGfxThread editor spikes when using Metal. Also fixed issue which caused the Game View FPS to drop when the editor was moved to a different display. In addition, fixed bad performance when Game View was displayed in a different window at the same time as the Scene View. (UUM-4697)

*   UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the UI Builder breaks the cursor property when saving by appending a comma between the additional parameters. ([UUM-872](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/backport-ui-builder-breaks-cursors-parameters-in-the-uss-file-when-changing-uss-files-values-in-the-ui-builder-window))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed memory leak when creating new PlayerPrefs with key that is longer than 25 characters. (UUM-4166)
    
*   URP: URP 2D - Fix bug when upgrading parametric lights to freeform lights. ([UUM-1869](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/parametric-light-upgrade-doesnt-dirty-scene-so-upgrade-might-not-be-saved))

### 2022.1.1f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Android: Bump Android Logcat package to 1.3.2 version.
    
*   Burst: Removed the requirement that `BurstLoader` has to initialize `BurstReflection` during a domain reload, making `BurstLoader` setup 2x faster during domain reloads.
    
*   Graphics: Using memoryless MSAA now also applies to the MSAA attachment when depth resolve is used.
    
*   Mono: Added support for direct ETW profiler integration on Windows Desktop for managed code, with no plugin required.
    

#### API Changes

*   iOS: Added: Added iPad Air 5 and iPhone SE 3 to devices.

#### Changes

*   Burst: Made Burst explicitly check for any compilation requests that came from `AssemblyBuilder`, and do not compile these with Burst. These exist outside the normal compilation pipeline, and Burst could not support them (but we now explicitly check for that case).
    
*   Burst: Made Burst's ILPP 22% faster by caching dependent assemblies that the being-processed assembly uses.
    
*   Core: NativeArray and NativeSlice Length is no longer reset when an instance is disposed, so as to ensure entry into iterators that would likely yield a disposed object exception.
    
*   iOS: Changed how selection is handled if it's set before the on screen keyboard has showed up.
    
*   Services: UGS packages are now available in the Package Manager.
    

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed 'require texture compression' setting being reset during player build. ([1397965](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-size-increased-on-first-build-when-compress-textures-slash-assets-on-import-is-enabled))
    
*   2D: Fixed issue where Sprite reference might be lost after upgrading. ([1398401](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-references-are-missing-in-the-sprite-renderer-when-importing-sprite-sheets-created-in-earlier-versions-of-the-editor))
    
*   AI: Fixed unidirectional NavMesh links creating erroneous connection between polygons. ([1328727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unidirectional-navmeshlink-results-in-navmeshagents-pathing-incorrectly))
    
*   Android: Added Initial launch size metadata into AndroidManifest.xml for Chrome OS devices with Android R or higher installed. (1360064)
    
*   Android: Fixed a bug with Unity UGUI and UI Elements input fields, where switching languages dynamically and IME functionality was not working. ([1395812](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-bluetooth-keyboard-can-only-type-in-english-when-keyboard-language-is-changed-to-any-other-language))
    
*   Android: Fixed a Unity Audio bug related to Bluetooth audio. This was causing issues with Vivox, and possibly other 3rd part audio libraries, with Bluetooth functionality. On Android, Bluetooth audio state is basically global, so Unity Audio now only makes the bare minimum changes to this state. We may still call startBluetoothSco and stopBluetoothSco when starting or re-initializing the audio output engine and when starting/stopping the Unity microphone. We may also call AudioManager.setMode when starting/stopping a Bluetooth mic through the Unity microphone APIs, but that's it. (1418634)
    
*   Android: Fixed XR subsystem initialization in case of app bundle + asset packs. ([1392895](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-xr-tracking-is-not-working-when-building-app-bundle-with-split-application-binary-enabled))
    
*   Animation: Fixed an issue where the parameter preview of the animator did not work anymore. ([1388833](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-blendtree-parameters-slider-value-is-stuck-at-0-when-trying-to-move-the-slider))
    
*   Asset Bundles: Ensure that padding is added after blocks info so that Switch patching works appropriately. This fix implies that loading newly generated AssetBundles will require using this new Unity editor/runtime combination. ([1403996](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/files-within-assetbundles-do-not-start-on-aligned-boundaries-breaking-patching-on-nintendo-switch))
    
*   Asset Import: Upgraded boost::asio version to v1.20.0. (1408567)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed issue with assert during accelerator client corruption detection. (1376291)
    
*   Build System: Dedicated server build will not inadvertently strip mesh data from meshes used for collision. ([1399961](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dedicated-server-data-from-mesh-colliders-are-stripped-in-dedicated-server-builds))
    
*   Build System: Removed legacy project file causing issues when opened through VSCode's Omnisharp. (1389396)
    
*   Burst: A potential issue with the debug info mover pass, that meant it only affected the first entry point in a module.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug when calling profiling `CreateMarker` on iOS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find `CreateMarker__Unmanaged`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where if you had synchronous compilation on a job, disabled Burst compilation and entered playmode, then exited playmode, and finally re-enabled Burst compilation, a hang could occur.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where if you used `FloatMode.Fast` with `math.pow`, where the `y` argument to `math.pow` was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (LLVM would try and call out to `powf` from the cstdlib).
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where toggling Burst enable <-> disable during a playmode execution using Burst, and then attaching the managed debugger, could cause an editor crash.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where using `ReinterpretStore(someIndex, (ushort)someValue)` could cause an internal compiler error in Burst.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a memory leak where during hashing we'd pin a GC object and never unpin and free it.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a potential deadlock whereby if Burst was compiling in the background (the background tasks window showed Burst in it) and a user switched from release to debug in the editor, Burst could cause a deadlock.

*   Android: Pdb files in development builds will now be stored along with the main apk file or main asset pack.
    
*   Animation: Added a warning to the user in case a transition that is smaller than a fixed update with root motion and non looping clip is made. ([1336151](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-movement-speed-of-an-animation-is-inconsistent-for-a-single-frame-when-transitioning-between-animations))

*   UI Toolkit: Asset types referenced from USS files are now enforced on a per-property basis and generates warnings instead of errors.
    
*   UI Toolkit: The inner hierarchy of InputFiels was altered. Queries that relied on a specific hierarchy order might be affected. Callbacks that were registered on inner components of the InputField might also be affected.  
    Examples of such queries:
    
    *   field.hierarchy\[1\]
        
    *   visualElement.Q()  
        Example of invalid RegisterCallback:

    *   Field.RegisterCallback(OnEvent, TrickleDown.TrickleDown);.
        
*   URP: 2D Lights now inherit from Light2DBase.
    
*   URP: Changed default target sorting layers of Light2D to "Everything". Newly added sorting layers will be included in Light2Ds that have target sorting layers already set to "Everything".
    
*   URP: Changed the default name when a new urp asset is created.
    
*   URP: Converted internal render targets to use `RTHandle` targets instead of `RenderTargetHandle` and `RenderTargetIdentifier`.
    
*   URP: Improved blending modes trigger a material update which tries to keep the existing look intact. This is not always possible and manual blend mode changes might be required.
    
*   URP: Main light shadow, additional light shadow and additional light keywords are now enabled based on urp setting instead of existence in scene. This allows better variant stripping.
    
*   URP: MaterialReimporter.ReimportAllMaterials now batches the asset database changes to improve performance.
    
*   URP: Multiply blend now keeps DstAlpha as it's RGB only.

*   URP: Removed the name input for the SSAO and Screen Space Shadows renderer features.
    
*   URP: Removed use of deprecated UNITY\_USE\_NATIVE\_HDR keyword in shaders.
    
*   URP: Separated Premultiplied blend mode and Preserve Specular Lighting feature from each other. Premultiplied blend mode is now true straight premultiply mode. Preserve Specular Lighting, which applies alpha differently for diffuse and specular parts of lighting, is now a separate option for Alpha and Additive blend modes. The results of previous Premultiplied blend implementation can be achieved by using Alpha blend mode with Preserve Specular Lighting toggled on.
    
*   URP: Set usage of `RenderTargetHandle` and public functions using `RenderTargetIdentifier` as obsolete for future removal.
    
*   URP: Split RendererFeatures `AddRenderPasses` into two functions with `SetupRenderPasses` so render targets can be used after allocation.
    
*   URP: Stripping shader variants per renderer features instead of combined renderer features.
    
*   URP: The behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to "Dont Care" has changed on mobile. Previously, "Dont Care" would behave identically to "Solid Color" on mobile. Now, "Dont Care" corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "Dont care" only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
    
*   URP: UniversalRendererData and ForwardRendererData GUIDs have been reversed so that users coming from 2019LTS, 2020LTS and 2021.1 have a smooth upgrade path. For 2021.2 Alpha/Beta users, you may encounter issues and are strongly recommended to start with a fresh library if initial upgrade fails.
    
*   URP: URP Asset Inspector - Advanced settings have been reordered under `Show Additional Properties` in each section.
    
*   URP: URP Asset Inspector - `General` section has been renamed to `Rendering`.
    
*   URP: URP will no longer render via an intermediate texture unless actively required by a Renderer Feature. See the upgrade guide for compatibility options and how assets are upgraded.
    
*   URP: VFX: New shadergraph support directly on Universal target.
    
*   URP: When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.

*   Burst: Fixed a bug that could prevent Visual Studio locating .pdb files while debugging.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug that meant Burst was accidentally enabled in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler (see changelog entry for 1.6.0-pre.1 for more context around this).
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug that was exposed by a Script Updater running against the Entities tests, whereby if some sort of pre-domain-reload code (some sort of teardown like thing) called into Burst, the script updater could have caused Burst to purge valid function pointers, resulting in us trying to execute a DLL location that we had already unloaded.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where a player build that had multiple assemblies that had structs declared with the same name and same contents but different `[BurstCompile]` methods in them, would wrongly only pick a single struct to Burst-compile.

*   Burst: Fixed a bug where if you had a long running compilation and a new compilation came in, some threads in the thread pool could (if unlucky) block trying to dirty the assembly in our Burst caching infrastructure while waiting for the compilation to complete.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where our `[BurstCompile]` job finding code would not find methods in generic base classes in places where we knew the concrete-generic type (for instance `struct Foo { [BurstCompile] struct MyJob : IJob { void Execute() {} } }`, `struct Bar : Foo {}`, and `struct Haz : Bar {}`
    
    *   we wouldn't find the concrete `Foo::MyJob` in Burst).
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where the compiler would reject a `try`/`finally` statement if it was the first thing in a method.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where we could leave background tasks around forever when we had actually completed them (could only happen if two re-compilation requests arrived close together, meaning we'd cancel the first but never report to the background tasks that we had cancelled them!).
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where `fixed` used in conjunction with `Span` or `ReadOnlySpan` would cause a compiler error.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug whereby complicated `try`/`finally` nesting could trip up the compiler.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug whereby sometimes some LLVM intrinsics could be incorrectly marked as unused causing invalid codegen with calls to `math.acos`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug with `sqrt_ps` for 128-bit types where it would crash the compiler.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a codegen issue with Unity 2021.2 and `System.Buffer.MemoryCopy`.

*   Burst: Fixed a performance regression affecting some vectorization in Burst 1.7+ (LLVM 12+).
    
*   Burst: Fixed a performance regression with `IJobParallelFor` where vectorization didn't happen for cases where it previously would have.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a really subtle caching bug in the compiler where if you had a job that compiled successfully at least once, then it failed (you used managed state for instance), then you closed the editor and restarted, if the compiler threads started in precisely a strange combination then Burst might accidentally never recompile the job which failed previously.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a super rare bug whereby if you kicked off two compilations very close together (most likely when running Unity in some sort of headless build-a-player mode), Burst could throw an exception on a burst hash cache file being locked by the process.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a Unity 2021.2 and newer bug that manifested with UWP builds - we were using the wrong `unityaot` folder in the Unity editor distribution with Burst.
    
*   Burst: Fixed access violation error that could occur when reading from a static readonly variable.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an exception that could occur if you had the Burst AOT Settings menu docked in the Editor, and then did a player build. Trying to change any of the Burst AOT Settings would throw an exception (unless you closed and reopened the Burst AOT Settings).
    
*   Burst: Fixed an internal compiler error when casting a void\* to a pointer-to-vector and then access the element.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where Debug.LogError logs from Bursted code would be treated as compiler errors. (1354070)

*   Burst: Fixed compiler error that occurred when calling `BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer` with a delegate type that was decorated with a custom attribute.
    
*   Burst: Fixed constant folding when using `Hint.Likely` or `Hint.Unlikely` intrinsics - the compiler is now able to fold these calls away entirely if the input value is constant.
    
*   Burst: Fixed editor crash when trying to debug a DirectCalled method.
    
*   Burst: Fixed error when trying to Direct Call a method belonging to a private nested type.
    
*   Burst: Fixed for the `X.pdb: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process` issue our users were seeing. We were taking a `FileShare.Read` lock, when we needed to take `FileShare.ReadWrite`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed issue that could cause bcl.exe to fail with an exit code of 1 but not output any compilation errors.

*   Burst: Fixed the "could not find path tempburstlibs" error message popping up when building for Android and Burst is disabled.
    
*   Burst: Fixed the Burst `link.xml` output to preserve C# methods we rely on, alongside the static constructors that we preserved previously.
    
*   Burst: Fixed the documentation to note that the `System.Runtime.CompilerServices` attributes `[CallerLineNumber]`, `[CallerMemberName]`, and `[CallerFilePath]` work with Burst, with the restriction that you cannot format the `[CallerMemberName]`, and `[CallerFilePath]` strings yet.
    
*   Burst: Fixed the very rare bug whereby the Burst Hash Cache files (\*.bhc) will sometimes cause an exception in the editor log.
    
*   Burst: Fixed the \[bug @tertle found\]([https://forum.unity.com/threads/burst-error-bc0102-unexpected-internal-compiler-error.1173977/](https://forum.unity.com/threads/burst-error-bc0102-unexpected-internal-compiler-error.1173977/)) when loading a vector from a struct pointer that is marked as `in`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed type initialization error, and invalid log messages about needing to add `[MonoPInvokeCallback]` to be compatible with IL2CPP, that could occur in a player build with Burst disabled.
    
*   Burst: ILPP issue for dots runtime whereby a calli patch could generate bad IL if the first instruction replaced was the target of a branch.
    
*   Burst: Improved UWP linker error message to clarify which VS components need to be installed for UWP.
    
*   Burst: Incorrect conversions between signed and unsigned vector types.
    
*   Burst: Inspector menu buttons were seen as available, even though they were not supported, when viewing i.e. .NET IL code.
    
*   Burst: Keybindings for copy and selection did not depend on OS. Now has proper "select all" and "copy" shortcuts for MacOS.
    
*   Burst: Linker errors on macOS due to long command lines, swapped to using filelists for inputs.
    
*   Burst: Linking would fail on non-Windows platforms if the project folder contained a single-quote.
    
*   Burst: Made it save the actual line numbers for code blocks in `_blockLine` even when the block is below the view.
    
*   Burst: Made `--burst-force-sync-compilation` command-line option actually work.
    
*   Burst: Missing output messages from some tools when a failure occurred.
    
*   Burst: One Definition Rule optimisation would break if multiple modules shared static constructors due to an issue with sharing code but not data.
