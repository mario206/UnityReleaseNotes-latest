2017.1.0f3 Release Notes (Full, diff from f2 at end)
----------------------------------------------------

### Known Issues

*   Audio: On Windows, AudioSource attached to VideoPlayer produces choppy sound when game iterations are overrunning. Will be fixed in future Unity release. (895458)
*   GI: Lit clustering debug visualization does not show (to be fixed in patch) (911953)
*   xR: Rendering problems on Pixel Daydream when using 4x or 8x MSAA with single-pass stereo. This is due to driver issues, so the problem will be addressed via a driver update, independently of Unity releases.

### Features

*   2D: Added Sprite Physics Shape to Sprite Editor, to allow users to set a custom default shape for a Sprite for generating collider shapes with a PolygonCollider2D.
*   2D: Introduced 2D Sprite Atlas, a new asset that will supplant the Sprite Packer. With it comes new and improved workflows that gives the developer more control on how to pack sprites and use them at runtime. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_spriteatlas.gif)
*   2D: Sprite Mask. Mask Sprites in world space using the new SpriteMask component. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_spritemask.gif)
*   Animation: Manual Keyframing Workflow. Separate Recording and Preview modes in the Animation Window. Contextual menus added to all animatable properties in the inspector.
*   Animation: New GameObjectRecorder in UnityEditor.Experimental.Animations ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_experimental_gameobjectrecorder.gif)
*   Audio: Added support for ambisonic audio clips and ambisonic decoder plugins.
*   Audio: Timeline Editor Audio Track support. Audio clips are now enabled in Timeline, using a scheduling API.
*   Build Pipeline: The Asset Bundle Browser comes out of beta with Unity 2017.1. This tool enables the user to view and edit the configuration of Asset Bundles for their Unity project. It is intended to replace the current workflow of selecting assets and setting their Asset Bundle manually in the inspector. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_ab_browser.png)
*   Collab: In-Progress. In-Progress allows developers using Unity Collaborate to see who else on their team has made local changes to a Scene or Prefab before those changes have been published. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_collabinprogressprojectbrowser.gif)
*   Editor: Added new [ArcHandle](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/IMGUI.Controls.ArcHandle.html) class in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls to interactively edit arcs in the Scene View. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_archandle.gif)
*   Editor: Experimental feature : retained-mode UI system for the Editor (UI Elements)
*   GI: Added support for baked LODs in Progressive Lightmapper
*   GI: Support for double sided materials in Progressive Lightmapper. Added a new material setting that causes lighting to interact with backfaces. When enabled, both sides of the geometry get accounted for when calculating Global Illumination. Backfaces do not count as invalid when seen from other objects. Backface rendering is not controlled by this setting nor will backfaces be represented in the lightmaps. Backfaces bounce light using the same emission and albedo as frontfaces.
*   Graphics: Added Custom Render Texture asset. A Custom Render Texture is a new type of Render Texture that can be easily updated with a shader. It provides a user interface and a scripting framework. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_customrendertexture.gif)
*   Graphics: Added LineUtility class and 'LineRenderer.Simplify' function. Optimize your lines and curves by using the LineUtility to create a simplified version with a similar shape.
*   Graphics: Added partial update/readback of compute buffers
*   Graphics: The latest version of the Post-processing stack is [available in beta](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/tree/v2). This new version offers improved effects and a complete framework for custom effects. It also comes with a volume-based blending feature, so you can define areas in the scene and set up specific looks when the player enters them. Unity will automatically blend between volumes to allow for smooth look transitions. Final release is expected this summer.
*   Graphics: Updated Splash screen logo and style
*   IMGUI: Added SearchField, a new IMGUI Control. It comes with Normal and Toolbar UI styles but can also be customized.
*   Input: Added new Player Settings property 'Input Manager' for enabling backend of new input system preview feature. The front-end is supplied separately and is not included with the release.
*   iOS: Enable deferred shading rendering path for Metal and OpenGL ES 3.0 for A8 and later iOS devices.
*   Particles: Added support for using Sprites in the Particle System, via the Texture Sheet Animation Module ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_particle_sprites.gif)
*   Particles: Apply Noise Module data to particles sizes and rotations, and also send the noise data to your shaders via new Custom Vertex Streams. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_particle_noise_1.gif) ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_particle_noise_2.gif)
*   Particles: New Donut emission shape. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_particle_donut.gif)
*   Playables: Playable Assets added to Playable API.
*   Playables: Playable Director added to play Playable Assets
*   Playables: Timeline Editor and Runtime API. A tool for sequencing animation, scripts and audio. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_timeline.png)
*   Scripting: Experimental support for new scripting runtime. This includes Mono 4.8 and IL2CPP with support for C# 6 and .NET 4.6 ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_1_feature_scriptingruntimeupgrade.png)
*   Shaders: Added support for "inline" sampler states.
    *   HLSL SamplerState objects that aren't taking sampling state from any texture (like what "sampler"+TextureName samplers do), but where sampling state is instead derived from the name.
    *   For example, "MyLinearClampSampler" sets up bilinear filtering and clamp wrap mode; while "point\_repeat\_sampler" sets up point filtering and repeat wrap mode.
    *   This allows e.g. doing both PCF depth comparison and reading raw depth value from a shadow map in a single shader.
    *   Note that generally only modern graphics APIs support separate textures & samplers. You might therefore want to specify #pragma target 3.5 or similar in your shaders for this.
    *   Implemented on DX11, DX12, PS4, XB1, Metal (Vulkan not yet).
*   Windows: Multi-display support for UWP.

### Changes

*   Asset Import: Upgraded FBX SDK to 2016.1.2
*   Build Pipeline: Added new function SwitchActiveBuildTargetAsync. This defers switching so that scripts can be imported first.
*   Build Pipeline: Event EditorBuildSettings.activeBuildTargetChanged has been deprecated as events do not survive script reloading. Replaced with interface class IActiveBuildTargetChanged and attribute ActiveBuildTargetChanged.
*   Editor: 2017 Editor now needs a new version of license. Subscription key will be upgraded. 5.x license key will not be accepted by 2017 Editor.
*   Editor: Added new GameObject sub menu - 'GameObject/Effects/. This menu includes a Line andTrail creation. The particle system has also been moved to this menu.
*   Editor: Added requirement for Visual C++ Runtime 2013 and 2015 to be installed when installing Windows Editor (i.e. the check is performed by Windows Editor installer).
*   Editor: AssetServer version control support has been removed from the editor.

*   OSX: Disabled Metal on macOS 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 for stability reasons if GLCore is also present in API list
*   Universal Windows Platform: DX11 feature level 9.3 GPU support is required now. In practice this probably does not affect anything, as all Windows Phones that ever existed support 9.3 level already.
*   Universal Windows Platform: Removed support for building Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 applications.
*   VR: Added OpenVR to the default PC VR SDK list. The default behavior is to try initializing Oculus first, followed by OpenVR if an Oculus device isn't detected.
*   VR: GPU skinning can be enabled for Android VR. This is experimental, and behavior and performance should be verified on target devices.
*   VR: Updated Google NDK for Android and iOS to 1.40
*   Windows: "Visible In Background" player setting now defaults to on.

### API Changes

*   Animation: AnimationLayerMixerPlayable scripting API added.
*   Area: Description [(FogBugz ID)](/Issuetracker)
*   Asset Import: Added ModelImporter.extraUserProperties
*   Asset Import: Added ModelImporter.importVisibility
*   Asset Pipeline: Added methods AssetBundle.GetAllLoadedAssetBundles and AssetBundle.UnloadAllAssetBundles. (920140)
*   Build Pipeline: Added delegates to [BuildPlayerWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPlayerWindow.html) that allow overriding the default Build button behavior
*   Editor: ArcHandle.radius can now be negative
*   Editor: PrimitiveBoundsHandle and subclass constructors no longer require a control ID hint
*   Editor: Removed unnecessary ArcHandle constructor taking a control ID hint
*   GI: Added new API for setting Light falloff per Light. Added API for setting all Lights to use physically correct inverse squared falloff or the Unity legacy falloff model. Only used for Enlighten lightmaps so far, realtime and progressive will be supported later.
*   Graphics: Added RenderTextureDescriptor struct that allows you to copy and create RenderTextures by passing a single value.
*   iOS: Added API to change iOS splashscreens.
*   iOS: iOSStatusBarStyle.BlackOpaque and iOSStatusBarStyle.BlackTranslucent are obsolete use iOSStatusBarStyle.LightContent instead (894136)
*   Light modes: Added QualitySettings.shadowmaskMode
*   Physics: Added 'Joint2D.attachedRigidbody' property to retrieve the Rigidbody2D attached to the Joint2D.
*   Physics: Exposed Joint.massScale & Joint.connectedMassScale. This allows adjusting masses and inertia tensors of the connected bodies as perceived by the solver. It's mostly useful for ragdolls that have high forces applied to their limbs and thus experiencing unpleasant stretchiness. This should also help avoiding setting the same mass for all the body parts of a ragdoll, as recommended before. See more in the API docs.
*   Playables: - Changed C# Playable classes to structures: new and better approach for the API, it uses less memory and is in line with the future job system.
    *   Remove properties in favor of getters and setters: since we're using class extensions that can't have properties, we decided to only use methods to have a consistent API (i.e. not properties there and methods here just because reasons).
    *   Rename ScriptPlayableData to PlayableBehaviour: the PlayableBehaviour is the user side of the ScriptPlayable, it is where the user puts its logic.
    *   Documentation is in progress expect a better one in a few weeks.
*   Playables: Moved Playable out of Experimental namespace.
*   Playables: New method PlayableGraph.IsPlaying()
*   Playables: Renamed PlayableGraph.Connect() parameters for clarity
*   Scripting: Add serialization support for unsafe fixed size buffers. See SerializedProperty.GetFixedBufferElementAtIndex docs for example code.
*   Scripting: Made GameObject.CalculateBounds() internal after it was accidentally made public in the 2017.1 beta cycle. This API is in the wrong place and will be moved/removed entirely in a future release
*   Scripting: Rename to Debug.logger to Debug.unityLogger (852000)
*   UI: Change isPaused to isFocused to better represent what it is. Only Effects 2017.1 betas
*   Web: (Also mentioned under Changes/Improvements) UnityWebRequest now has built-in support for downloading MovieTexture on platforms that do support it. A new helper class WebRequestMultimedia has been introduced for simple download of MovieTexture or AudioClip. WebRequest.GetAudioClip() has been deprecated in favor of WebRequestMultimedia.GetAudioClip().
*   Web: A new UnityWebRequest.timeout property that gives the user some coarse-grain control over the time a webrequest can take before unity attempts to cancel it.
*   Web: Added timeout property to UnityWebRequest. (823903)
*   Web: Moved UnityWebRequest.GetTexture() to UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture().
