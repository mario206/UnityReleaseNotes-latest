### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   2D: ISpriteEditor has a new interface method GetMainVisualContainer to allow adding UIElements for GUI controls
    
*   Android: Moved all Android icons to 'mipmap' folder
    
*   Android: Removed PVRScope support
    
*   Editor: Gtk+ 3.4+ is now required to run the Unity editor on Linux
    
*   Editor: When importing PSD, we no longer tweak its colors to remove white matte color impact. That means that texture colors will look exactly same as if image was "flattened" in Photoshop (alpha is kept intact)
    
*   Graphics: Vulkan now always uses RenderTextureFormat.ARGBHalf as RenderTextureFormat.DefaultHDR. Before RenderTextureFormat.ARGBFloat, if supported, was used on desktop platforms.
    
*   IMGUI: Added TreeView.getNewSelectionOverride. This override is required in order to support selection via clicking/keyboard while building only the visible rows.
    
*   iOS: As we dropped support for pre-iOS8, we no longer need two codepaths in orientation handling.
    
*   Multiplayer: The deprecated legacy networking APIs have been removed
    
*   Package Manager: Previous versions of Unity used to rely on a predetermined set of packages to get loaded automatically into every project. As of 2018.2, only packages that are listed in the manifest.json file of the project are loaded. To make this happen, a project manifest migration script is applied to existing projects when first opening it in 2018.2 (beta8+).
    
    This change was made to allow more flexibility in managing core Editor packages. It also makes the package configuration more explicit since it is now clear, by looking at manifest.json, what packages are part of the project.
    
*   Profiler: Added automatic creation of label on recorder creation ([881136](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-recorder-dot-get-does-not-return-any-values-for-canvas-dot-sendwillrendercanvases))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Deprecated AppCallbacks::AddCommandLineArg() and AppCallbacks::ParseCommandLineArgsFromFiles(). You now must pass command line arguments into AppCallbacks constructor. In addition, we also deprecated PlayerSettings.WSA.commandLineArgsFile API in the editor. (1001513)
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Removed "-forceTextBoxBasedKeyboard" command line argument.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Removed support for old Windows Phone devices (the ones with pre-DX10 GPU, i.e. everything older than Adreno 4xx).
    
*   WebGL: Allow WebAssembly heap to grow
    
*   WebGL: Configured toolchain so it does not generate WebAssembly trapping instructions.
    
*   WebGL: Enable Data Caching option in new projects
    
*   WebGL: Upgraded toolchain to emscripten 1.37.33 and binaryen 42
    
*   WebGL: WebAssembly is the default Linker Target on new projects
    
*   XR: Standalone applications which target and require Windows Mixed Reality will now always attempt to initialize the device, even if no HMD is connected or the Mixed Reality OS component is not installed (rather then falling back to flat desktop mode.) This will cause the OS to display a dialog indicating that the user needs to connect a device and install the OS component.
    

### Changes

*   Android: WebCamTexture is implemented using android.hardware.camera2 package for devices which support API level 21
    
*   Animation: Linear presets now use Auto tangents, for better initial behavior when dragging the keys
    
*   Editor: Added options for better behaviour when script compilation is triggered while the editor is playing. You can choose between them in Preferences>General>Script Changes While Playing
    
*   Graphics: Added 'physical camera mode' to the camera component with sensor size, focal length and lens shift properties.
    
*   Particles: Moved "Show Only Selected" (aka Solo Mode) option to the Scene View Overlay, from the Particle System popout Window, so it is more discoverable. ![description](/sites/default/files/2018_2_improvement_particle_solo_mode.png)
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: .NET scripting backend has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Unity release. We recommend switching to IL2CPP scripting backend.
    

### Improvements

    *   You can provide user data to menu action. You can retrieve it in your action callbacks using menuItem.userData.
    
    Breaking API changes:
    
    *   menu action callbacks now takes a ContextualMenu.MenuAction parameter instead of an EventBase parameter.
    *   ContextualMenu.InsertSeparator takes an additional string parameter.

*   Editor: Test Runner window: Run All and Run Selected always run tests respecting the currently selected name and category fixes
    
*   Editor: Users can override the selection outliner if they add this pass. Tags{ "LightMode" = "SceneSelectionPass" } Should return: return float4(\_ObjectId, \_PassValue, 1, 1);
    
*   GI: Cache a LightingData asset when baking in auto mode, so scripts in play mode switching to an auto-baked scene can recover all GI data
    
*   GI: Reduced memory usage while baking with Progressive Lightmapper when using many instances.
    
*   Graphics: Add LOD fade support for particles/lines/trails

*   AI: Change structure name in the Experimental API for Navmesh Queries from `PolygonID` to `PolygonId`.
    
*   AI: New experimental API for NavMesh queries, usable within C# jobs: `namespace UnityEngine.Experimental.AI`; `struct PolygonID`; `struct NavMeshLocation`; `enum PathQueryStatus`; `enum NavMeshPolyTypes`; `struct NavMeshWorld`; **`struct NavMeshQuery`** with these functions: `BeginFindPath()`, `UpdateFindPath()`, `EndFindPath()`, `GetPathResult()`, `IsValid()`, `GetAgentTypeIdForPolygon()`, `MapLocation()`, `GetPortalPoints()`, `MoveLocations()`, `MoveLocation()`, `PolygonLocalToWorldMatrix()`, `PolygonWorldToLocalMatrix()`, `GetPolygonType()`, `Dispose()`.
    
*   Animation: Refined the experimental Anim C# Jobs API, renamed and changed some fields in AnimationStream and AnimationHumanStream (e.g. IsValid() becomes isValid, GetBodyLocalPosition() becomes bodyLocalPosition, 'DoF' renamed to 'Dof', etc.)
    
*   Asset Import: Added AssetImportContext.DependsOnSourceAsset to make it possible to report source dependencies during imports, in ScriptedImporters.
    
*   Asset Import: Changed the localID output argument of AssetDatabase.TryGetGUIDAndLocalFileIdentifier from int to long. Using an int might cause overflows if used on objects with localids over INT\_MAX, which can happen on objects attached to prefabs.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Deprecate `AssetDatabase.TryGetGUIDAndLocalFileIdentifier` with int localID parameter, use the overload of this function that uses a long data type for the localId parameter, because this version can return a localID that has overflowed. This can happen when called on objects that are part of a Prefab.
    
*   Editor: Added AssemblyBuilder.defaultReferences and AssemblyBuilder.defaultDefines read-only properties
    
*   Editor: Added Editor.finishedDefaultHeaderGUI event to inject additional controls into Inspector header
    
*   Editor: KeyDown events receiving a KeyCode and KeyUp events are now used by text fields in the Editor when the user is entering text. Previously they only used KeyDown events producing printable characters. If you have controls that draw after a text field that need to be aware of these events, you should test for them before drawing the text field.
    
*   Graphics: Camera.focalLength Camera.sensorSize Camera.lensShift Camera.usePhysicalProperties
    
*   Graphics: Removed the implicit power slider behavior from \_Shininess properties on user-defined shaders. If you need old behaviour back you can add the attribute \[PowerSlider(5.0)\] in front of the property.
    
    \[PowerSlider(5.0)\] \_NameOfVar ("Name Of Variable", Range (0.01, 1)) = 0.078125 This will give the \_NameOfVar a slider that is a power slider. ([965967](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/value-of-the-shader-property-jumps-from-minimum-value-to-0-dot-1-when-it-is-defined-with-range-min-max))
    
*   Graphics: Rendering.CommandBuffer.SetRenderTarget overloads that accept RenderBufferLoadAction, RenderBufferStoreAction
    
*   Package Manager: Expose package keywords in Package Manager C# API
    
*   Playables: Rename SetInputPort to SetOutputPort. Added the traversal mode option (Mix, or Passthrough)
    
*   Scripting: Application.isBatchMode
    
*   Timeline: Timeline.TimelineEditor.inspectedAsset Timeline.TimelineEditor.masterAsset Timeline.TimelineEditor.inspectedDirector Timeline.TimelineEditor.masterDirector
    
*   Timeline: Timeline.TimelineEditor.timelineAsset - Reason: Ambiguous - Replaced by: inspectedAsset and masterAsset Timeline.TimelineEditor.playableDirector - Reason: Ambiguous - Replaced by: inspectedDirector and masterDirector
    
*   UI: New API for disabling Undo on DrivenRectTransform to stop and resume recording undo actions on Driven RectTransforms.
    
*   Video: MovieTexture - MovieImporter have been marked as deprecated.
