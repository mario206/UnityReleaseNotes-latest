    A debug panel also has live reporting of the current prefetched mips in the markers debug screen. We also add a checkbox to debug disable streaming, which helps content creators see which textures are on and off. (UUM-29814)
    
*   Windows: Fixed sizeof type error in StackWalker library.

*   Build Pipeline: Fixed an invalid build path error that triggers when building for WebGL on Windows. (UUM-27982)
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where IOS may fail to build in Xcode if script debugging is enabled. (UUM-12364)
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed Player Build fails. ([UUM-1205](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/build-fails-until-scrolling-scenes-in-build-in-build-settings))
    
*   Core: Fixed memory ordering issues in the job system that could occur on platforms with a weak memory model. Platforms such as Android, iOS, and Apple Silicon OS X could potentially see hangs or crashes due to reading old values that had been written to inside of a job. (UUM-32220)
    
*   DX12: Fixed a crash where command lists were not being cleaned up. (UUM-27446)
    
*   Editor: Added tooltip support to UnityEvent header label. ([UUM-16433](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tooltip-prefix-is-ignored-when-used-with-unityevent))
    
*   Editor: Enabled GameObjects from the 31st layer to be rendered when `Camera.cullingMask` is set to **Everything**. ([UUM-2698](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gameobjects-from-31st-layer-are-not-rendered-when-camera-dot-cullingmask-is-set-to-everything))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue in the Frame Debugger with errors that appear when you enable the debugger when it was docked with the Game Window. ([UUM-17193](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/frame-debugger-frame-debugger-window-doesnt-open-and-throws-errors-when-docked-with-game-window))

This change allows now to turn off this feature (which changes adaptive sampling rate) and saves massive amount of performance. This knob improves performance massively while keeping image quality consistent.  
    The second knob is high and low res PBR dof checkbox. The previous drop down has been removed, since PBR DoF has always been half res, independent of the previous enum value. This new knob now shows true representation of resolution. The new low res setting lets PBR DoF run at quarter resolution. (UUM-26281)
    
*   HDRP: Added error when MSAA and non-MSAA buffers are bound simultaneously in custom passes. ([UUM-22996](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-in-hdrp-if-the-user-selects-a-custom-color-and-camera-depth-buffer-with-msaa-on-it-silently-breaks-and-doesnt-render))

*   HDRP: Enabled the volumetric clouds to be synced per camera. Previously, the clouds were synced through a global time, leading to discrepencies with cameras that update at different rates. ([UUM-21985](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-volumetric-clouds-are-synced-per-camera-and-not-via-a-global-time-leading-to-discrepencies-when-you-have-a-cameras-that-updates-at-different-rate))

*   HDRP: Fixed material upgrader when executing tests. (UUM-20743)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed memory leak in HDLightRenderDatabase when switching between editor and play and no lights are in the scene. ([UUM-29271](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-leak-error-when-no-directional-light-is-present-in-the-scene-and-leak-detection-level-is-enabled))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed ray-traced emissive reflections. (UUM-30969)

*   HDRP: Fixed the exposure for SSR debug rendering. ([UUM-19575](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-screen-space-reflections-debug-is-not-working))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed the init order that could cause DXR setup to fail after using the HDRP wizard to enable DXR on an existing HDRP project. ([UUM-21776](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-game-view-is-black-and-the-editor-throws-a-nullreferenceexception-after-restarting-the-editor-when-pressing-the-fix-all-button-in-hdrp-wizard))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed the label and improved documentation for After Post Process depth test flag to give more detail about "Depth Test" being automatically disabled in some cases.
    
*   HDRP: Fixed the low resolution transparents using Shader Graph. ([UUM-21628](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-buffers-sampling-in-shadergraph-is-broken-when-using-low-resultion-pass))

### 2022.2.13f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Graphics: Added BatchCullingContext.cullingFlags to specify whether lightmapped shadow casters should be culled for this view.

#### Improvements

*   Apple TV: TvOS now uses launch screen storyboard.
    
*   iOS: IOS/tvOS launch screen now is shown only by OS, and is not shown again by Unity itself.
    
*   Player: Added -native-leak-detection command line argument to Unity Editor and standalone players. can be Disabled, Enabled, or EnabledWithStackTrace. Stack Traces are only available in the Unity Editor and development builds.
    

#### API Changes

*   Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` returns the maximum number of job workers that can work on a job at the same time. The job system will create a number of job worker threads that will be no greater than the number of logical CPU cores for the platform. However, since arbitrary threads can execute jobs via work stealing we allocate extra workers which act as temporary job worker threads. `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` reflects the maximum number of job worker threads  
    plus temporary workers the job system will ever use. As such, this value is useful for allocating buffers which should be subdivided evenly between job workers since `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` and `NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute` will never return a value greater than `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`. (UUM-29945)
    
*   Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` returns the index for the current thread when executing a job, otherwise 0. When multiple threads are working on a parallel job at once, no two threads will have the same index. The range is \[0, `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`). The value returned when called from within a job is the same as the one stored in a job member decorated with `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute`, otherwise 0. (UUM-29945)
    
*   Editor: Added: GetSampleMetadataAsSpan to RawFrameDataView.
    

#### Changes

*   Kernel: Made NativeArray.Dispose consistent when disposing uninitialized container.
    
*   Version Control: Updated branding from "Plastic SCM" to "Unity Version Control"  
    Improved offline experience by disabling the plugin when there is no internet connection.

### 2022.2.5f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   EmbeddedLinux: Now enabled via BootConfig parameters, Editor Setting and has a scripting entrypoint.

#### API Changes

*   HDRP: Added: DecalShaderGraphGUI.SetupDecalKeywordsAndPass - Adding back a public API used to validate shadergraph materials by user scripts.
    
*   Scripting: Added: Object.FindFirstObjectByType() and Object.FindAnyObjectByType() functions added as potentially faster alternatives to Object.FindObjectOfType(). These new functions let you decide whether you must have the first (lowest InstanceID) object found or if any instance is adequate. In the latter case the function can be many times faster as no internal sorting is required. See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.
    
*   Scripting: Added: Object.FindObjectsByType() function added as a potentially faster alternative to Object.FindObjectsOfType(). This new function gives users the choice whether or not to perform the expensive sorting by InstanceID on the returned collection of objects rather than having it always performed wasting time when unnecessary. See the scripting documentation for Object.FindObjectsByType() and Object.FindObjectsOfType() for more details.
    

#### Changes

*   Documentation: Added documentation for public-facing methods:  
    
    *   EditorUserBuildSettings.SwitchActiveBuildTarget

### 2022.2.2f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Universal RP: Added Temporal Anti-aliasing support. Available from Camera Anti-aliasing settings. Known limitations: Incompatible with MSAA, Dynamic Resolution or Camera stacking. Supports fixed resolution only, no temporal upsampling supported.

#### Improvements

*   Build Pipeline: Improved error handling for builds to show less redundant error messages.
    
*   Editor: Improved performance of Handles.DrawAAPolyLine.
    
*   Editor: Improved performance of rendering the Project Settings. It would previously repeatedly query all objects loaded into the editor, which meant that operations that load assets into memory (entering playmode) would make the Project Settings unusable slow.
    
*   Graphics: Registration of the Shader.globalRenderpipeline is done internaly and using the renderPipelineShaderTag from the RenderPipelineAsset that is currently in use.
    
*   Physics: Increased the Articulation Body tree limit from 64 to 256 bodies.
    
*   Profiler: Reduced the performance cost of drawing charts in the profiler.
    
*   VFX Graph: Fixed lightmap range limitations. (UUM-19058)
    

#### API Changes

*   Build Pipeline: Obsoleted: Application.SetBuildTags and Application.GetBuildTags are now obsolete.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Overridable property renderPipelineShaderTag on the RenderPipelineAsset.
    

#### Changes

*   Universal RP: Shader parameters used by additional lights are now removed when additional lights are disabled in URP Assets.

#### Fixes

*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where the standalone profiler could crash or emit errors when the script domain reloads in the editor. ([UUM-19179](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/edit-mode-recording-standalone-profiler-crashes-on-stopassetimportingv2internal-when-reloading-the-domain))
    
*   Build Pipeline: Doing a clean build will remember state about built files, so that files no longer in a build can be deleted in subsequent builds.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed a bug where building a development player, and then a non-development player with no other changes could show the "Development Player" watermark.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed a potential bug where building players could in rare circumstances fail with a sharing violation on a file called buildreport.json\_2.traceevents.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where build GUIDs would sometimes not change between subsequent builds.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Make postprocess callbacks correctly report player path for "install in builds folder". (UUM-4118)
    
*   Core: Fixed ShaderGraph code generation to properly enable GPU instanced properties. ([UUM-20505](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-graph-shader-instance-property-gets-added-to-cbuffer-which-causes-gpu-instancing-with-instanced-properties-to-not-work))
    
*   Editor: Added a check to ensure context view context can't be duplicated, copied or cut. ([UUM-2655](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-opened-in-context-can-have-its-root-duplicated-creating-uninteractable-gameobjects-that-dont-get-saved-with-the-prefab-1))
    
*   Editor: Added a proper error message when trying to run the Editor in a misconfigured environment with no HOME variable set (Mac and Linux). ([UUM-14787](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-crash-when-opening-project-while-home-is-null))
    
*   Editor: Added EditorSceneManager event for RestoreSceneManagerSetup so systems can get notified about it. (UUM-19655)
    
*   Editor: Camera relative culling options have been added to the Graphics section in Project Settings. This will potentially alleviate light popping issues due to lack of precision when the objects or lights are far from the origin. Enabling the camera relative culling setting for lights will potentially introduces issues for objects or lights that are far from the camera origin. ([UUM-7551](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/spot-light-flickers-when-when-its-far-from-the-origin-point))
    
*   Editor: Converting the root in a Prefab Asset to a Prefab instance to create a variant is now disallowed, similarly as Replace Prefab instance. This guard is added to prevent loosing default overrides and references for all instances of the Prefab.'. ([UUM-20181](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2022-dot-2-feature-reconnect-to-prefab-in-prefab-mode-can-break-references))
    
*   Editor: Fixed a bug when zooming in using the orthographic camera, the terrain texture was previously rendered incorrectly. Now when zooming in, the texture on the terrain should be rendered correctly. ([UUM-1809](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/patches-of-terrain-lose-detail-when-zoomed-in-with-orthographic-camera))
    
*   Editor: Fixed a bug which caused **auto** with **Generate Lighting** to not work as expected in connection with DOTS. Auto mode will now be ignored in the backend when the core Entities package is used.  
    **Note:** An inspector window and the lighting settings window will show the value of 'Auto Generate' which has been set in the lighting settings asset. The lighting window will show a warning if **Auto Generate** is ticked but it will not prevent the user from doing so.  
    Note that the following lighting window UI changes have been included in the fix:  
    **Auto Generate** is not disabled when the Entities package is used. The checkbox will represent the actual value in the lighting settings asset.  
    The warning is only shown if **Auto Generate** is ticked and the text is updated to say **Auto Generate mode is ignored \[...\]**. (UUM-18955)
    
*   Editor: Fixed a crash when a window is closed during EditorWindow.OnLostFocus. ([UUM-12434](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/error-slash-crash-when-editorwindow-dot-close-is-called-in-editorwindow-dot-onlostfocus))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue if -createProject is used would force script recompile. (UUM-10810)
