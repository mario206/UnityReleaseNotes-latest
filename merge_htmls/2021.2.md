*   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where BuildPlayerOptions.assetBundleManifestPath to be used when building player was not allowed. ([1399616](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/buildplayeroptions-dot-assetbundlemanifestpath-can-not-be-set-by-using-buildplayerwindow-dot-registerbuildplayerhandler))
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug when calling profiling `CreateMarker` on iOS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find `CreateMarker__Unmanaged`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a issue where burst was enabled in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler (see changelog entry for 1.6.0-pre.1 for more context around this).
    
*   Burst: Fixed an access violation error that could occur when reading from a static readonly variable.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an exception that could occur if you had the Burst AOT Settings menu docked in the Editor, and then did a player build. Trying to change any of the Burst AOT Settings would throw an exception (unless you closed and reopened the Burst AOT Settings).
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where codegen differences could occur when using a local vector variable that was being captured by reference and passed to a called function, versus when it wasn't.

*   Burst: Fixed an issue where if you used `FloatMode.Fast` with `math.pow`, where the `y` argument to `math.pow` was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (LLVM would try and call out to `powf` from the cstdlib).
    
*   Burst: Fixed another rare case of the file-is-locked bug where the Burst IL Post Processor could incorrectly hold a file lock on a pdb.
    
*   Burst: Fixed errors when working with paths containing special characters.
    
*   Burst: Fixed the Burst `link.xml` output to preserve C# methods we rely on, alongside the static constructors that we preserved previously.

### 2021.2.1f1 Release Notes

#### API Changes

*   Shaders: Added: Added a possibility to query preprocessed shader data for a given variant ([1364378](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/no-way-to-get-preprocessed-data-using-pass-dot-compilevariant))

#### Fixes

*   Android: Further improve build times, when sequential build is done with no changes in project. Previously Unity was moving apk/aab from gradle project to final location, thus forcing the gradle to rebuild apk/aab on sequential builds, Unity will perform a copy instead now. Our tests show that sequential build times improved by 50%, for ex., dropping from 12 seconds to 5 seconds. (1361602)
    
*   Android: Workaround a problem where using logcat would leak pipes on OSX. The underlying problem seems to be with C# Process class, where if you redirect streams and dispose process, the pipes would remain opened. This will be investigated separatly. ([1303618](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-adb-functionality-leaks-a-pipe-causes-too-many-open-files-error))
    
*   Animation: Fixed an issue where an assert was triggered upon rebuilding an animation legacy component. ([1330001](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-m-curves-when-playing-animation-after-reenabling-object))
    
*   Asset Bundles: Improved performance of Asset Bundle building when many bundles exist. ([1358059](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/building-process-of-the-assetbundles-is-slow-when-the-file-count-is-huge))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where MonoScripts in plugins that were dependent on plugins in other folders could fail to import when reimporting all assets. ([1345854](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mono-scripts-in-dlls-fail-to-import-when-reimporting-all-assets))

*   Asset Pipeline: Improved opening time of Import Activity Window. ([1343709](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/import-activity-window-takes-long-time-to-open))
    
*   Audio: Fixed exposing multiple send levels in the audio mixer not working correctly. Note: previously created mixers with exposed send levels will cause a warning to be logged on editor startup and the send levels will have to be re-exposed. ([1285638](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-mixer-unable-to-expose-other-send-level-parameters-when-one-is-already-exposed))
    
*   Editor: Fixed windows editor sometimes getting into a "script assemblies are locked" state after invoking a modal dialog from a C# script. ([1367358](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-asemblies-get-locked-when-trying-to-recompile-after-opening-and-closing-openfolderpanel-window))

*   Asset Pipeline: Added **ArtifactDifference Reporting** messages to the **Artifact Browser**.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added Accelerator authentication support using Unity ID.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added Import Activity Window. This allows you to look at import times, previous revisions, list dependencies, see importers used and import duration over time.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Support for importing models and textures in parallel in external processes (off by default, enable in Project Settings ->; Editor ->; Refresh.
    
*   Burst: Added a new optimization mode, `Balanced`. This is now the default optimization mode, and trades off slightly lower maximum performance for much faster compile times.
    
*   Burst: Added an `OptimizeFor` option to `[BurstCompile]`, allowing users to specify whether they want to prioritize runtime speed, runtime size, or compilation time.
    
*   Burst: Added Embedded Linux as a new target platform for Burst.
    
*   Burst: Added Embedded Linux toolchain resolution mechanism.

*   Burst: Added warnings about delegates being used by `BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer` that are not decorated as expected. In most cases, Burst will automatically add the C-declaration attribute in IL Post Processing, but if the usage of CompileFunctionPointer is abstracted away behind an open generic implementation, then Burst will not be able to automatically correct the delegate declaration, and thus this warning will be displayed.

*   Package Manager: Changed the Package Manager window so that when users choose to continue from the UPM dialog warning that shows an entitlement error, then launch the Editor, the Package Manager window immediately opens to the first package with an entitlement error.
    
*   Package Manager: Swapped the advanced settings panel and the scoped registries management panel in project settings.
    
*   Package Manager: The Package Manager now supports packages with entitlements (subscription-based licensing).
    
*   Particles: Added a mesh weighting field to the list of meshes in a **Particle System** component, to control how likely Unity is to assign each mesh to a particle.
    
*   Physics: Added a new CustomCollider2D that allows custom 2D physics shapes to be used with a fully customizable and featured 2D Collider.
    
*   Physics: Added an **Enable All** and **Disable All** button to the Physics Project Settings' **Layer Collision Matrix**, which allows enabling or disabling all layer collisions.

*   Profiler: Added ProfilerModule API to extend the Profiler window with custom modules.
    
*   Profiler: Added the _File Access Profiler_ and _Asset Loading Profiler_ modules to the Unity Profiler.
    
*   Profiler: The connection drop down has been revamped into a tree view that groups player connections int0 three main categories. Local, any player that is running local to the machine, this includes devices connected via cable. Remote any player that is running anywhere else on the network that is reachable. Direct connection, this is for connecting directly via IP address or any player that has automatically connected. There options are further searchable using the new search bar.  
    Any connections to players which exist from before this feature will still appear though they will appear under the category of "Connection Without Id".  
    Further to this there no exists an option that can be used to supply a custom connection name for the profiler which will make it easier for the user to find their desired connection. This is set through the Preferences->;Anaylsis option or via the command line "-connection-id" when launching a player from the command line.
    
*   Scene/Game View: Added support for component tools to the **EditorToolContext**.
    
*   Scene/Game View: Introduced new Overlays feature. Tools and contextual views are now available directly in the Scene View, and are completely customizable.
    
*   Search: Added a new explicit provider to search performance metrics.
    
*   Search: Added new extended search picker workflow and API.
    
*   Search: Added search expression language to evaluate multiple search queries and apply set operations, transformation or other user defined operations.
    
*   Search: Added search table support to build advanced reports using complex search expressions.
    
*   Shaders: Added support for specifying package requirements for SubShaders and Passes to ShaderLab.
    
*   Shaders: Introduced keyword space separation.  
    Shaders, compute shaders and materials now operate in separate local keyword spaces. All keywords declared in a shader or in a compute shader using any of the multi\_compile\* or shader\_feature\* directives are local. Material and Compute Shader classes now operate with local keywords only.  
    Global keyword space contains global keywords. Global keywords are converted to local keyword space of a shader or compute shader prior to rendering. When a shader or a compute shader declares a keyword that has the same name as a global keyword, turning this global keyword on or off will affect variant selection.
    
*   Terrain: Added a new instancing mode for Terrain details, which uses the material specified on the prototype prefab to render detail objects with instanced draws.

    *   Auto configuration of SSO
        
    *   Added date column in incoming changes
        
*   WebGL: Added support for compressed audio in WebGL.
    
*   WebGL: Added the _Debug Symbols_ player setting to create release builds with embedded function symbols for improved profiling and error stack traces.
    
*   WebGL: Added the texture subtarget build setting to WebGL.
    
*   WebGL: Enabled ETC/ETC2/ASTC/BC4/BC5/BC6/BC7 compressed texture formats for WebGL in editor, build and runtime.
    
*   XR: Added support for controller late latching, which can reduce latency between rendering and tracked input (head and hand-held controller) in XR. Can be used with the Mesh Renderer and the Skinned Mesh Renderer.
    
*   XR: Reduced render latency in URP with Late Latching.
    

#### Improvements

*   2D: Added folder support for SpriteAtlas V2 in 2D.

*   2D: Improved performance for setting multiple Tiles on a Tilemap.
    
*   2D: Improved performance of RuleTile caching.
    
*   2D: Improved performance when importing large number of textures.
    
*   2D: Improved the placement of Tiles generated from Sprites with Textures sliced using the Isometric Slicing option in the Sprite Editor.
    
*   2D: Prereleased the SpriteShape and PSDImporter package
    
*   2D: Updated icons for the Tile Palette Rotate and Flip tools.
    
*   2D: Updated the 2D template to use the latest verified 2D packages.
    
*   2D: Updated the 2D URP template starting folder structure for better clarification of usage.
    
*   2D: Updated the Skinning Editor tooltips text.
    
*   AI: Added the `RasterizeModifierBox` profiler marker for the NavMesh builder step that processes ModifierBox sources.
    
*   Android: Added a new Android/Chrome OS player setting, "Chrome OS Input Emulation". If un-checked, this option disables Chrome OS's default behavior of converting mouse and touchpad events into touchscreen events. This allows an app to implement more complete support for these input devices. Also, fixed a bug with Android/Chrome OS touchpad scrolling.
    
*   Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch `platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold`. This specifies which CPU cores to treat as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.
    
*   Android: Added support for custom cursors to Android to support Player Settings and C# functions on Android version 7.0 and later.
    
*   Android: Allow low-level configuration of Unity threads (priority, affinity)
    
*   Android: Changed the device scanning operation of the Android Extension to be async when receiving an USB device changed event. ([1349380](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/opening-project-which-doesnt-target-android-stall-for-a-few-seconds-with-scanning-for-usb-devices))
    
*   Android: If a hardware keyboard is available, Unity now uses it within UI systems, instead of always bringing up a virtual, on-screen keyboard.
    
*   Android: Made a large part of the Android Build Pipeline incremental which means sequential builds with zero changes are now much faster. That also means Unity no longer creates builds from scratch, but instead updates the files which dependencies have changed. If you use the IPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject callback, note that it might be operating on files which were modified by IPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject from a previous build.
    
*   Android: Unity gradle projects now have a new entry in gradle.properties, unityTemplateVersion. Unity increments this property whenever Unity gradle template files change. That way if you build on top of the old folder and the unityTemplateVersion is different, Unity throws an error, saying that you need to update your gradle files or build to an empty folder.
    
*   Android: When generating manifest files, there are new files in Library\\Bee\\artifacts\\Android\\Manifest, LibraryManifestDiag.txt, LauncherManifestDiag.txt. They contain information about why a specific permission is added to manifest.
    
*   Asset Bundles: Added profile marker for CRC checks.
    
*   Asset Import: Documented the `MonoImporter` class.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved FBX model importing speed.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import performance of ASCII FBX files.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import performance of FBX files.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed for FBX files that use the ASCII file format.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed for model files containing more than 1 mesh.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed of FBX models by skipping unused data.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed of models that contain multiple meshes.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed of Sketchup models.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved model import speed by multithreading mesh triangulation.

*   Asset Import: Improved the model import times slightly for models that contain animations.
    
*   Asset Import: Increased the speed of Asset Import when using mikktspace tangent generation on meshes containing degenerate triangles.
    
*   Asset Import: Optimized the texture import mipmap calculation when using Kaiser filtering. For example, importing 16GB of textures with mostly Kaiser mip filters is reduced from 127 seconds to 109 seconds.
    
*   Asset Import: Reduced peak memory usage during Model Importing.
    
*   Asset Import: Updated Sketchup SDK to version 2020.2.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added a new UI in the AssetImporter inspectors that display all AssetPostprocessors methods that were used in the last import of the selected asset.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added summary in the editor log about what happened during a refresh (import).
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added warnings and an _Automatic Fix_ button where main object names do not match the corresponding filename.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved directory enumeration by multi-threading it.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved project startup times. Projects with 900,000 files will load at least 30 seconds faster.

*   Asset Pipeline: Improved startup performance for 900,000 file project by 18 seconds.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved upload and download path.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Optimized the UnityEngine.Hash128.ToString method.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: The Asset Pipeline no longer displays a warning when it is not possible to move import worker log files.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Unity prefetches Asset Databases to improve Editor startup time and reduce cost of page faults.
    
*   Audio: Added a new _Attenuation_ transition type to AudioMixer so that it can perform equal power panning for group attenuations when transitioning between snapshots. (1322673)
    
*   Audio: Added voice priority display in the audio pane of profiler.
    
*   Audio: Added VU metering information from audio mixer groups in the audio pane of profiler to make it easier to compare it against volume and audibility levels.
    
*   Audio: Improved the way Unity displays audio mixers inside the Audio Profiler window when the Groups and Channels and Groups view modes are enabled.  
    Previously, Unity applied the column-based sorting from the Channels view mode to the other view modes, which resulted in inconsistent sorting of channels and groups below mixers, and in mixers changing their order dynamically. This made the Audio Profiler window hard to read.  
    Unity now shows the names of the mixers in the Profiler where it previously only showed the ambiguous Master groups of the mixers below the Audio Listener group.  
    The triangle shape after the titles of the column headers in the Detailed and Clip views was changed to an arrow that more clearly indicates the sorting order. The arrow is now placed before the title instead of after it to avoid cutting the title off when you resize the columns manually.
    
*   Audio: Target mixer groups are now displayed in the audio profiler.
    
*   Bug Reporter: The Crash Handler window now includes the following UI changes:
    
    *   _Stack trace_ field
        
    *   _Go to crash logs_ button
        
    *   _Report a Bug..._ button
        
    *   _Open Unity Hub_ button  
        Note that clicking the _Open Unity Hub_ button restarts the Editor.
        
*   Build Pipeline: "Scripts Only Build" is now automatic for platforms using the new incremental build pipeline. The checkbox is removed for such platforms, and Unity will automatically detect if it can do a Scripts Only Build based on which changes there are in the project.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Changed Linux so that it uses the incremental player build pipeline.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Improved linking speed for big projects
    
*   Build Pipeline: Improved the performance of the build pipeline by giving concurrent shader cache folders read access.
    
*   Build Pipeline: MacOS Standalone player builds now use the new incremental build pipeline, which allows faster subsequent player builds by only rebuilding parts which have changed.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Modified Windows Standalone player builds so that they only rebuild parts that have changed since the previous build to improve build speed.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Removed prompt to save an untitled scene if it is not included in the build.
    
*   Build Pipeline: WebGL now uses the incremental Player build pipeline.
    
*   Burst: Automatically add \[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)\] to any delegates that are used for BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<;>;() or error if the delegate has the attribute and it is not Cdecl.
    
*   Burst: Improved codegen.
    
*   Core: Modified the Dynamic Heap Allocator to reduce the time it takes to intantiate chunks in a Build. ([1272168](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/slower-performance-of-instantiate-when-using-it-in-a-build-compared-to-the-editor))
    
*   Core: Reduced the number of memory alllocations and improved the tracking of core allocations.

*   Documentation: Improved documentation for GeometryUtility.TestPlanesAABB to explain false positives.
    
*   DX12: \*Binded dynamic lightmaps resources (Enlighten) to ray tracing shaders: `unity_DynamicLightmap`, `unity_DynamicDirectionality` and `unity_DynamicLightmapST`. \*Enabled `DYNAMICLIGHTMAP_ON` shader keyword for when these resources are used by Renderers.
    
*   DX12: Added the ability to set D3D12\_RAYTRACING\_GEOMETRY\_FLAG\_NO\_DUPLICATE\_ANYHIT\_INVOCATION flag when adding Renderers to a RayTracingAccelerationStructure. This will allow implementation of robust colored ray traced shadows.
    
*   DX12: Optimized uniform setup in ray tracing shaders, and added a special case for the `UnityPerMaterial` cbuffer.
    
*   Editor: Added a context menu to the Console window which has an option to use monospace font. (1276112)
    
*   Editor: Added ability to reorder UnityEvent callbacks.

*   Editor: Now shaders will have SHADER\_API\_(DESKTOP|MOBILE) define set according to the target build platform.
    
*   Editor: Optimized BC7 ("high quality" compression setting on PC/Console platforms) texture compression. Performance is 2-3 times faster. This optimization uses a new texture compressor (bc7e). An option is available in Editor Settings to switch to the old one (ISPC) if needed.
    
*   Editor: Optimized drag selection in Editor scenes.
    
*   Editor: Reduced the per-test overhead of running tests in the editor.

*   GI: Extended support for the Lit Clustering Scene View exposure control so that it is available for lightmaps created with Enlighten Baked Global Illumination.
    
*   GI: Hid the **Show Inactive Objects** and **Isolate Selection** checkboxes on the Static Emissives tabs of the Light Explorer because these options are not applicable to materials. ([1331750](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/show-inactive-objects-and-isolate-selection-checkboxes-are-shown-static-emissives-tab-of-light-explorer-but-are-pointless))

*   Search: Use a single Search Provider to search for any indexed object.
    
*   Serialization: Improved the way that `SerializeReference` handles missing types. Instances where the type is missing are replaced with `null`. Other instances are editable and if there are fields that previously referred to the missing type which are still null, the missing type is preserved.
    
*   Serialization: Objects referenced from `SerializeReference` fields now have stable IDs, which reduces the risk of conflicts when multiple users collaborate on a scene file. Additionally, it also improves support for Undo and Prefab modes, especially when `SerializeReference` is used inside arrays and lists. In addition, references now come with a new format with backward compatibility support for older assets.

*   Virtual Texturing: Updated tile requests to be returned via `PopRequests` more frequently.
    
*   Virtual Texturing: Updated `InvalidateRegion` calls to generate new tile requests in their "importance" order. The importance is defined as a combination of the tile's screen space size and the the number of frames since the tile has been requested. This makes completing tile requests contribute more to the rendering result when `InvalidateRegion` is called continuously.
    
*   Web: Updated UnityWebRequest's libCurl backend (used on most platforms).
    
*   WebGL: Added support for Screen Orientation Locking and Auto-Rotating for mobile browsers which supports the Screen Orientation API.

*   Graphics: Added: Mouse & touch input support for Rendering Debugger runtime UI, and fix problems when InputSystem package is used.
    
*   Graphics: Added: New API functions inside DynamicResolutionHandler to get mip bias. This allows dynamic resolution scaling applying a bias on the frame to improve on texture sampling detail.
    
*   Graphics: Added: New API in DynamicResolutionHandler to handle multicamera rendering for hardware mode. Changing cameras and resetting scaling per camera should be safe.

    *   Support custom per-instance data for RenderMeshInstanced(), per-instance motion vector and rendering layer mask definitions, and easy light probe setup
        
    *   Support for multi-command indirect draws & future proofing for hardware implementation on supported platforms

*   Graphics: Added: RenderTexture.depthStencilFormat and RenderTextureDescriptor.depthStencilFormat properties. You can now set the exact Depth/Stencil buffer format on a RenderTexture using the depthStencilFormat property. Before, each platform backend would decide what format is used without any control or visibility. The existing APIs that take a number of depth bits will still select the same format as before on each backend. When upgrading RenderTexture assets from an older project, all Depth/Stencil buffers that had more than 16bits will be converted to D24\_UNorm\_S8\_UInt. On high end platforms, this could result in 24bits for depth instead of 32bits resulting in visual artifacts. You need to change the Depth/Stencil format on the RenderTexture asset if that is the case.

*   Universal: The function to upgrade from LWRP to URP was removed. If you want to upgrade your ptoject from LWRP to URP, you must first upgrade to a previous URP version, and then upgrade to this version.
    
*   Universal: The method ClearFlag.Depth does not implicitly clear the Stencil buffer anymore. Use the new method ClearFlag.Stencil.
    
*   Universal: The Opacity as Density blending feature for the Terrain Lit shader is now disabled when the Terrain object has more than four Terrain Layers. This behavior is now similar to the Height-blend feature of the Terrain Lit shader.

*   URP: Made 2D shadow casting more efficient.
    
*   URP: Modified the behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to "Dont Care" on mobile. "Dont Care" now fills the render target with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which might be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should only use "Dont care" if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
    
*   URP: Moved all 2D APIs out of the experimental namespace.
    
*   URP: Moved the advanced settings in eachg section of the the URP Asset Inspector to **Show Additional Properties**.
